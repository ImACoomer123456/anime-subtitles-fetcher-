1
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,898
This one isn't dead. Just paralyzed.

3
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,317
On this floor, of all places?
Can you revive him?

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,652
Not sure.

5
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,790
Good. Looks like you're revived.

6
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,630
We were wiped out?

7
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,007
My necklace is gone.

8
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,385
My coins are gone, too.

9
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,512
And so are all the jewels.

10
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,557
We lost some of our belongings.

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,975
Do you know anything about it?

12
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,769
No doubt about it.
They were taken out by Treasure Bugs.

13
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,687
Shh!

14
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,647
Nah, we don't know a thing.

15
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,733
We found you all
lined up nicely on the ground.

16
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,487
Some folks must have
passed here before we did.

17
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,823
A strand of hair.

18
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,492
It's magic to ward off ghosts.

19
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,579
Someone definitely
came in contact with us.

20
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,749
An elf...

21
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,751
A tall-man...

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,255
{\an8}A half-foot... And a dwarf.

23
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,008
They had a meal here.

24
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,593
A meal?

25
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,386
They sure have some nerve.

26
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,387
Let's go after them.

27
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,972
Hold up.

28
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,516
We're not a charity, you know.

29
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,520
Here.

30
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,771
Thanks.

31
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,026
Why didn't you tell them?

32
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,485
It's simple.

33
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,863
The more corpses, the better.

34
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,787
I really want to wash my hair soon.

35
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,789
You'll feel refreshed
if you crop your hair.

36
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,584
There you go again, saying mean things.

37
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,587
Don't you want
to wash your beard as well, Senshi?

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,466
How long has it been
since you last washed it?

39
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,884
Let's give it a wash right now!

40
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,804
Your hair plays an important role
in magic, too.

41
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,558
Taking care of it is like warm-up.

42
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,479
With your beard like that,
my support magic might not work on you.

43
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,939
That would be just great.

44
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,317
Right! I have really nice soap.

45
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,487
I'll wash your beard with it and braid it!

46
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,825
Huh? I can't find it.

47
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,704
<i>Right, that day...</i>

48
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,916
No way! It was so expensive, though!

49
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,209
Let's go.

50
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,962
<i>On the fourth basement floor,</i>

51
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,131
<i>there is a lake formed
by underground water</i>

52
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,175
<i>flowing through carved-out bedrock.</i>

53
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,721
<i>The magic-infused water
emits a faint glow,</i>

54
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,307
<i>and far in the depths of the water,</i>

55
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,726
<i>the castle town can be seen
like a wavering illusion.</i>

56
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,981
How do you usually explore
the fourth floor, Senshi?

57
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,651
I fish and set traps around here.

58
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,152
That's about it.

59
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,989
How do you fellows get through this place?

60
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,866
With magic, of course.

61
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,452
I use this to do this and...

62
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,746
There!

63
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,917
We walk across on water.

64
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,086
N...

65
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,004
N...?

66
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,006
No!

67
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,133
No!

68
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,759
-No!
-No need to get so upset.

69
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,970
-No!
-This won't work.

70
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,888
{\an8}Let's tie a rope around him
and drag him along.

71
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,015
{\an8}No.

72
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,726
Put a spell on him
while I'm holding him down.

73
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,477
-What?
-With his armor...

74
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,273
With his armor, it's the only way
to get him across the water.

75
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,275
It's too dangerous to take a boat.

76
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,154
People easily fall for the path of ease.

77
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,741
It takes only a moment to get rusty,
but it takes a long, long time to...

78
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,658
There!

79
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,037
See? It wasn't such a big deal, was it?

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,413
Y-You...!

81
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,542
I don't get it.
Why do you hate magic so much?

82
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,212
You people are too casual
when it comes to using magic.

83
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,173
That's something I don't understand.

84
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,758
Now, now.

85
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,301
What's done is done.

86
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,928
You might actually like it.

87
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,558
-Huh?
-Huh?

88
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,226
W-Why?

89
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,312
Why isn't my magic working
as well as it should?

90
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,813
This must be it.

91
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,690
Ugh, is this an insulator?

92
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,735
It's soaked with the oils
and blood of various monsters.

93
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,861
Ew!

94
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,321
Wash it off quickly!

95
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,364
I'm not sure
if it will come off with just water...

96
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,741
No need.

97
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,703
I will get across the water in my own way.

98
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,954
Huh?

99
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,331
Are you gonna build a boat?

100
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,957
You'll sink like a stone in no time.

101
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,503
No, he must have some amazing plan.

102
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,671
You sure have a lot of confidence in him.

103
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,964
I don't get it.

104
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,466
Watch me.

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,096
-Is that the outer shell of a Mimic?
-Shh!

106
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,985
A Kelpie!

107
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,695
Watch out! Get back!

108
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,697
It's fine. It's harmless.

109
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:51,327
Anne is a horse
that always shows up whenever I fish.

110
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,245
Anne?

111
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,749
For a while now, I've been wondering
if I could use her to get across the lake.

112
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,126
-What?
-What?

113
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,255
Perhaps I can use the Mimic's shell
to steer her somehow.

114
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,133
T-That's...

115
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,717
so cool!

116
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,760
{\an8}THIS SCREAMS ADVENTURE

117
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,262
I'm against it.

118
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,891
I think it'd be more practical
to use its guts to make a float.

119
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,060
H-How can you say that?

120
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,020
How cruel of you!

121
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,148
Monsters are dangerous.

122
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,400
Especially ones that are charming.

123
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,028
Kelpies make you lower your guard
and entice you into the water.

124
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,407
You can never know
what's going on in a monster's mind.

125
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,244
I've known Anne for a long time,
just like I've known the golems.

126
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,913
I know her much better than you.

127
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,334
Why does everyone
have a soft spot for mammals

128
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,337
when they won't let me grow
a Man-eating Plant?

129
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,257
Do you really not know why?

130
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,926
Let's go, Anne!

131
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,433
-Senshi!
-Senshi!

132
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,601
-Marcille!
-Huh?

133
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,569
<i>Anne...</i>

134
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,327
<i>Stop it, Anne!</i>

135
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,500
Laios!

136
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,214
Forgive me, Anne.

137
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,973
No way.

138
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,017
No way!

139
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,478
Please no!

140
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,489
So, she was waiting for me
to get on her back?

141
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,700
But she could've attacked me
whenever she wanted.

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,660
I don't know.

143
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,955
There's no knowing
what a monster is thinking.

144
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,666
I don't understand.

145
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,459
I don't understand at all.

146
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,258
You must be cold.

147
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,385
I'll start a fire right now.

148
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,845
Hey!

149
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,015
You were that fond of her,
and now you're going to eat her?

150
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,226
Unbelievable.

151
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,269
Why, though?

152
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,312
Can I help?

153
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,523
No.

154
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,858
I'll do it on my own.

155
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,533
Hey.

156
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,287
Can I get some of the fat?

157
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,123
What brought this on?

158
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,459
Just an idea.

159
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,467
What on earth are we doing here?

160
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,885
Chilchuck.

161
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,847
Something is floating over there.

162
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,390
It better not be people.

163
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,516
Let's go and take a look.

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,643
What? I'd rather not.

165
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,899
What are these white things?

166
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,984
It's grain.

167
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,819
Looks like it's been spilled.

168
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,863
And here are the owners.

169
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,782
Let's draw them out of the water.

170
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,576
What is it?

171
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,579
Doesn't his face seem familiar?

172
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,580
Nope.

173
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,458
Oh, I know this kobold!

174
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,627
We found him dead
on the third basement floor.

175
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,795
How did they get ahead of us?

176
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,221
So, they met a Mermaid
and killed each other.

177
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,807
{\an8}The poor... things...

178
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,937
Chilchuck?

179
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,732
Chil! Chilchuck!

180
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,569
Chil!

181
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,479
They never let me finish the song,

182
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,564
even though
I took the trouble of remembering it.

183
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,277
That should do it.

184
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,073
We shouldn't let
the scattered grain go to waste.

185
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,449
Let's gather the grain for them.

186
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,034
That's going too far.

187
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,078
Then let's take them for ourselves.

188
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,830
It'll make Marcille happy.

189
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,665
<i>Poor Marcille.</i>

190
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,963
No!

191
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,881
I didn't say anything yet.

192
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,843
You promised not to go for demi-humans!

193
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,846
{\an8}Demi-humans...

194
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,973
What are they?

195
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,099
What do you mean?

196
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,101
<i>Mermaids come in different forms.</i>

197
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,103
<i>Some are mammals,
while others are more like fish.</i>

198
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,147
This one's in the fish category.

199
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,566
It lays eggs, so it doesn't have
a belly button or nipples.

200
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,608
Instead, it has gills.

201
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,571
They're farther removed
from humans than cows or pigs.

202
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,531
What?

203
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,993
-No way!
-What?!

204
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,870
Why, though?

205
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,497
Why can we eat cow but not a Fish-man?

206
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,499
It just doesn't feel right.

207
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,501
{\an8}Feel?

208
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,837
Feel, huh?

209
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,717
They're still at it.

210
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,678
I'm starting to feel hungry,
so how about we whip something up?

211
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,265
<i>Throw the grains in water
and put it over a fire.</i>

212
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,143
<i>Toss in some flaked Mimic
and waterweeds, then...</i>

213
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,519
Wait a minute.

214
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,897
That's the stuff that was growing
on the Fish-man's head.

215
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,400
Yeah, but this is just a normal plant.

216
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,652
The Fish-men use it to camouflage.

217
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,198
Without it, they'd look even more fishy.

218
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,493
Does it still upset your feelings?

219
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,536
<i>This is starting to become a bother.</i>

220
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,289
Fine. Have it your way.

221
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,045
<i>I think I might've made
an error in judgment just now.</i>

222
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,630
All right. It's ready.

223
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,049
PORRIDGE WITH SCATTERED BARLEY

224
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,885
Marcille, Senshi, let's have lunch.

225
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,137
Is it that time already?

226
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,556
Where did you manage to find some grains?

227
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,267
I scavenged them
from the fallen adventurers over there.

228
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,810
What on earth were you thinking?

229
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,564
<i>Good question.
I knew Marcille wouldn't disappoint.</i>

230
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,150
But you already cooked them, so.

231
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,152
I'll dig right in!

232
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,120
Hmm, there's a pop in the texture.

233
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,497
What is it?

234
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,790
Probably fish eggs.

235
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,875
They must've been on the water weeds.

236
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,127
It tastes good.

237
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,088
I know, right?

238
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,673
I'm glad I added them.

239
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,341
Come with me.

240
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,842
Hey!

241
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,136
Those were a Fish-man's eggs,
weren't they?

242
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,764
I've heard Fish-men have
a habit of laying their eggs on waterweeds

243
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,350
that they wear on their heads
to protect them or something!

244
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,060
What's the matter?

245
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,812
Marcille.

246
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,732
Does it taste good?

247
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,778
Yeah!

248
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:28,993
Senshi.

249
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,745
This is for you.

250
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,499
I made soap using the Kelpie's fat.

251
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,169
Kelpie's fat is often used as hair oil,

252
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,255
but it can also be used
for clothes and dishes.

253
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,552
Can I use it right now?

254
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,263
It's still being saponified,
so I'm not sure.

255
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,140
I want to give it a try.

256
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,017
You put a lot of effort
into making it, right?

257
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:55,853
Okay.

258
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,311
Thank goodness!

259
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,438
Now, we can move ahead together.

260
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,982
I see.

261
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,777
Now that it's come to this,
I've realized something.

262
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,698
Walking on water
actually feels quite nice.

263
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,826
Thank you, Marcille.

264
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,207
Some soap got into my eye.

265
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,261
Leave this to me.

266
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,722
I'll wipe them out!

267
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,974
Don't!

268
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,147
-Watch out!
-Ow!

269
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,151
I told you not to!

270
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,737
An underwater explosion
kills too many of them!

271
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,655
What?

272
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,575
These Blade Fish can be stewed,
grilled, steamed,

273
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,245
dried, smoked, or eaten raw.

274
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,664
They're delicious
no matter how you prepare them.

275
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,709
But they're a food source
for other monsters as well.

276
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,921
If their population decreases,
it could disrupt the dungeon's ecosystem.

277
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,590
So you should get them one at a time.

278
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,051
What? You're asking too much!

279
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,636
Now that I think about it,

280
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,305
it seems like there are fewer
mid-sized monsters around than usual.

281
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,306
See?

282
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,018
I can't just go easy on them, though.

283
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,936
Not when they're trying to kill us.

284
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,440
If anything,
there are more Blade Fish than usual.

285
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,567
I don't think there's anything
to be concerned about.

286
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,694
But what if the monsters end up starving?

287
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,822
I don't want to die
just to protect their ecosystem!

288
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,371
You people are too quick
to take the easy path.

289
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,584
What? Then you should try
taking them out one by one.

290
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,752
It's hard, you know!

291
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,298
You should think about the ecosystem more...

292
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,594
What's going on?

293
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,762
Senshi!

294
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,683
What was that all about?
They just passed by us.

295
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,602
Are you hurt?

296
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,313
Senshi?

297
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,691
Something is approaching.

298
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,776
What?

299
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,202
You're kidding, right?

300
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,454
It's way too huge!

301
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,590
A squid?

302
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,300
Or is it an octopus?

303
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,593
It's a Kraken!

304
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,304
It's a big monster to begin with,

305
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,556
but this one's a few times larger
than the usual ones!

306
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
It's so cool!

307
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,519
What do we do?

308
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,395
If we act rashly, it's gonna get us!

309
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,897
We'll draw its attention!

310
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,607
I'm counting on you, Marcille.

311
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,110
Magic again?

312
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,987
Relax. I'll strike it this time.

313
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,617
Here it comes!

314
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,786
Don't stop running!

315
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,336
Right there!

316
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,298
I did it!

317
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,184
No way! It didn't take a hit!

318
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,897
Using a weapon on it will only
slice through its outer skin at most.

319
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,501
There must be magic I can use...

320
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,878
Marcille!

321
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,630
-Use your magic again.
-What?

322
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,216
I can't pull off such a powerful magic
in quick succession.

323
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,134
No.

324
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,719
This will do.

325
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,639
I mean, this is your first encounter
with a Kraken, right?

326
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,809
Do you even know
what kind of monster it is?

327
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,269
-I don't.
-What?

328
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,438
I don't know much about Krakens,

329
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,024
but I have cleaned
squids and octopuses before.

330
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,902
Watch out, Marcille!

331
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,153
It's heading your way!

332
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,533
Water-Walk!

333
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,425
To kill a squid or an octopus,

334
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,677
stab it right between the eyes!

335
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,690
Amazing.

336
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,442
Huh?

337
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,735
Where's Laios?

338
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,198
Hey. I'm over here.

339
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,329
Looks like this creature was devouring
all the medium-sized monsters.

340
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,540
Both of you, come here.

341
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,338
You should try cleaning a cephalopod
at least once.

342
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,717
Stab squids and octopuses here
to kill them neatly.

343
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,970
Do squids and octopuses taste good?

344
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,430
No way! You've never tried them?

345
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,474
They taste really good, you know!

346
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:12,104
You can stew, grill, steam, dry, smoke,
or even enjoy them raw.

347
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,982
{\an8}They really taste great
no matter how you cook them!

348
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,735
I know a good place,
so I'll show you there next time.

349
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,153
Can't I try one now?

350
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,990
I dug my own grave!

351
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,993
Wow, this is so weird!

352
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,995
How do I eat this?

353
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,247
Let's try salting it.

354
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,377
-It stinks.
-Well, well!

355
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,421
It tastes awfully bitter.

356
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,631
It's making my mouth tingle.

357
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,509
Marcille, do you really
eat this in various dishes?

358
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,512
No, I don't!
That's a weird misunderstanding!

359
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,649
How marvelous!

360
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,569
A big parasite for a big monster!

361
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,779
Ew, disgusting!

362
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,947
Throw it away now!

363
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,782
What's all the fuss about?

364
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,201
Most creatures
have parasitic worms inside them.

365
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,663
And many of them end up in our meals, too.

366
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,332
You didn't have to tell me that!

367
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,209
Well, if we cook it,
we should be able to eat this as well.

368
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,377
No!

369
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,671
That's one way of looking at it.

370
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,465
I said no!

371
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,027
Let's try broiling these with some sauce.

372
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,534
It's upsetting how amazing it smells!

373
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,252
It's done!

374
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,922
BROILED AND GLAZED
GIANT PARASITIC WORM

375
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,012
It's good!

376
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:13,016
I can't quite put it into words,
but it's really soft and delicious!

377
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,852
It's got a bit of a slime,
but it's quite meaty.

378
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,191
I-It's good.

379
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,359
Not bad.

380
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,154
This has a delicious taste
that's unlike your typical fish.

381
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,490
Isn't it even better
than squid or octopus?

382
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,492
That's not...

383
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,745
true, probably.

384
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,290
I'm pretty sure this would be delicious,
no matter how you prepare it as well.

385
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,668
I had a bite of it raw,
but it went down nicely.

386
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,503
Hold on, you ate it raw?

387
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,130
Just a little.

388
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,965
It was already dead, so it should be fine.

389
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,760
The fish are eating the Kraken.

390
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:53,265
That should help the medium-sized monsters
slowly come back.

391
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,270
My stomach...

392
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,273
Ow...

393
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,650
What's the matter? Are you okay?

394
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,860
Well, well...

395
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,237
It's just as I thought.

396
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,783
Laios, what you have is the parasite
that was inside the giant parasitic worm.

397
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,121
<i>It's the same kind
you find in your average fish, too.</i>

398
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,998
<i>I spotted one
when I was cleaning the big worm.</i>

399
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,040
<i>It can't be...</i>

400
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,168
It won't parasite on a human,

401
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,045
but it does make a hole in your stomach,
which can be very painful.

402
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,882
All you can do is wait for it to die.

403
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,552
I think I might die first.

404
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,096
Why not throw a healing spell
on him every now and then?

405
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,306
Good idea.

406
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,433
But I see now.

407
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,186
<i>The Fish-men eat the Blade Fish,</i>

408
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,521
<i>and the Kraken eats the Fish-men.</i>

409
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,899
<i>We took down the Kraken,</i>

410
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,942
<i>and the little fish feast on its flesh.</i>

411
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,863
<i>Laios ate the parasitic worm
inside the Kraken,</i>

412
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,200
<i>and the parasite within that worm
ended up poking a hole in Laios' stomach.</i>

413
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,372
I guess it was a little arrogant of me
to try to protect the ecosystem.

414
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:04,461
Right from the start, we were already
a part of the dungeon's circle of life.

415
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,465
<i>Laios attempted to speak,</i>

416
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:13,470
<i>but the excruciating pain and nausea
left his mind completely empty.</i>

417
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,308
<i>The agony, which felt as if knives
were slicing through his insides,</i>

418
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,559
<i>persisted all night.</i>

419
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,148
<i>And he vowed
never to eat a parasitic worm raw again.</i>

420
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:57,032
