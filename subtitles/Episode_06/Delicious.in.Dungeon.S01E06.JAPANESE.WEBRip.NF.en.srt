1
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,568
It's locked again.

3
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,903
Give me a minute.

4
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,279
I'll open it in no time.

5
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,159
{\an8}We walked quite a bit already,

6
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,162
{\an8}so maybe we can call it a day soon.

7
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,460
You sure are clever, Marcille,
answering with your stomach.

8
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,921
It wasn't me!

9
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,673
It's completely normal.

10
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,801
After all, we've only had snacks today.

11
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,346
But Laios, I'm against taking a break.

12
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:23,768
The only foodstuff we found today
was a bowl full of Treasure Bugs.

13
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,605
{\an8}Even if we have to push ourselves,
we should make for the fourth floor.

14
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:33,319
Still, the monsters will get tougher
and tougher the further we go.

15
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,780
I think we should conserve our energy.

16
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,658
But even if we save our energy,

17
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,577
it won't matter
if we pass out from hunger.

18
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,581
But without energy,
we wouldn't be able to defeat monsters...

19
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,667
It's open.

20
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,804
This room looks like
it used to be a dining hall.

21
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,807
This must've been a luxurious dining table
once upon a time.

22
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,066
But now, it's just the dead
haunting this place.

23
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,027
There's not even a single rat in here.

24
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,695
I'm not eating a rat, okay?

25
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,700
I wonder why it's always
dead humans who attack us.

26
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,786
Can't a whole roasted pig
come after us for a change?

27
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,204
Don't be silly.

28
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,749
{\an8}"Come after us"...

29
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,960
But we do have...

30
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,006
food coming after us!

31
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,844
Living Painting?

32
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,970
Watch it, Laios!

33
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,099
You got too close!

34
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,351
You could've gotten sucked in!

35
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,312
{\an8}That's what I wanted!
I was just getting to the good part!

36
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,230
{\an8}What?

37
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,233
There were grapes in that painting.

38
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,901
In other words,

39
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,904
you were trying
to eat the food in the painting.

40
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,531
That's right.
Pretty neat idea, don't you think?

41
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,242
-Absolutely not!
-You moron!

42
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,662
-Moron! What were you thinking?
-Ever heard the saying, "pie in the sky"?

43
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,415
I-I know you can't
actually eat a pie in the sky.

44
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,086
But a painting of someone
eating a pie in the sky works!

45
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,422
You'll end up getting killed
inside the painting.

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,049
{\an8}Precisely!

47
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,678
{\an8}Inside the painting, we should be able
to interact with each other!

48
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,351
Fine. Have it your way, then.

49
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,061
But you can only give it a try once.

50
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,147
We'll tie a rope around you.

51
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,651
If you give us a signal,
we'll pull you out.

52
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,612
Which painting should I go for?

53
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,573
This one looks pretty good.

54
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,742
There's a lot of delicious food in it.

55
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,453
All right, I'll go for this painting.

56
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,215
Ow.

57
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
Hey, you.

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
<i>I've already been spotted!</i>

59
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,595
That sword...

60
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
You're wearing odd armor,

61
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,434
but you're one of the castle guards,
aren't you?

62
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,351
Huh?

63
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,187
Here, carry this.

64
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,108
Seriously, we're always
running short on hands.

65
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,777
This way! Don't space out!

66
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,618
Look at his face. He looks so clever!

67
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,622
Yes, the shape of his nose
is just like yours.

68
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,626
He will lead the kingdom
splendidly one day.

69
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,131
-There, there. You're a good boy.
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,300
Stop daydreaming!

71
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,135
Bring the next plate already!

72
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,638
-Um, could I have a bite...
-I have it!

73
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,225
{\an8}Delgal! Your name is Delgal!

74
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,272
Delgal, you'll become a great king!

75
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,356
This is no good!

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,484
There's no chance of me eating anything!

77
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,196
Help me out!

78
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,448
It's his signal!

79
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,783
Pull!

80
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,746
How was it?

81
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,959
I was so close to getting a bite.

82
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,213
{\an8}But the vibe just wasn't right.

83
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,632
{\an8}-The vibe?
-That's what stopped you?

84
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,843
{\an8}Yeah, it was totally the vibe.

85
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,428
One more time!

86
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,056
I can grab a bite
if the situation is more suitable.

87
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,350
What do you mean by "suitable"?

88
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,601
Let's see.

89
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,563
I guess it needs to be more casual.

90
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,901
Casual?

91
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,113
How about this one?

92
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,740
They have fancy food,
it looks like a party,

93
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,408
and there's even someone dancing naked.

94
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,868
This is it! Here I go!

95
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,963
You drunk fool!

96
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,882
What do you think you're doing
in front of the king?

97
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,718
Get down from the table now!

98
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,845
Oh, stop it.

99
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,848
{\an8}Today is my wedding day.

100
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,601
Pardon this man for getting
a little too carried away.

101
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,812
But Prince Delgal...

102
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,522
<i>Delgal?</i>

103
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,858
<i>Is he the baby in the painting earlier?</i>

104
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,276
Come on, go!

105
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,863
<i>That was a close call!</i>

106
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,614
Delgal!

107
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,366
Father!

108
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,203
I am glad to see
how splendidly you have grown.

109
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,498
To the future of this kingdom.

110
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,348
F-Father!

111
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,560
He was poisoned!

112
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,898
<i>Guess I'll take some back with me
and enjoy them quietly later.</i>

113
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,279
Sorry.

114
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,530
Your Majesty!

115
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,449
Treat him now!

116
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,408
Hurry!

117
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,578
<i>That elf, I spotted him
in the previous painting as well.</i>

118
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,413
<i>I wonder if he's a jester or something.</i>

119
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,669
Look what I've got!

120
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,421
I brought back food this time...

121
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,049
Wait, what? It's all gone!

122
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,678
{\an8}So I can't take food out of the painting.

123
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,431
{\an8}The only way is to eat them
inside the painting!

124
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,268
Again! Now that it's come to this,
I must have a taste of the food!

125
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,569
FULL-COURSE OF COURT CUISINE

126
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,408
<i>Is this a crowning ceremony?</i>

127
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,411
<i>So that prince succeeded to the throne.</i>

128
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:05,211
May this kingdom and its people
flourish for eternity.

129
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,346
<i>It's good!</i>

130
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,310
<i>It's good!</i>

131
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,771
<i>I thought it might taste like paint,</i>

132
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,232
<i>but this is a real feast!</i>

133
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,704
Seconds, please.

134
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,710
<i>I sure ate a ton.</i>

135
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,753
I'm stuffed.

136
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,674
Guess I'll go back now.

137
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,972
<i>Huh? This is...</i>

138
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,602
-You don't belong to this castle.
-<i>Damn!</i>

139
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,687
What are you doing?

140
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,315
You were there when the prince was born
and also at his wedding.

141
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,610
What is your purpose?

142
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,236
Are you after the throne?

143
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,116
I'll reduce you to ashes right now!

144
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,704
The painting!

145
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,918
Did something happen inside the painting?

146
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,714
There were tons of mouthwatering dishes.

147
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,425
As I was about to leave
after eating my fill,

148
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,387
someone realized I was an outsider,
grabbed me by the collar,

149
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,182
{\an8}and got really mad.

150
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,850
{\an8}I'm not surprised.

151
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,436
{\an8}I was so scared.

152
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,775
Now that I'm relaxed,
I'm starting to feel hungry again.

153
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,988
{\an8}Wait, what? Even though I ate a lot,
my stomach still feels empty!

154
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,199
What did we tell you?

155
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,534
It was just a pie in the sky!

156
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,244
You wasted our time!

157
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,081
But it really tasted good!

158
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,047
Was this the kitchen?

159
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,509
We can collect water
from the room next door,

160
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,719
and it's a nice spot to rest for a bit.

161
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,722
If you hadn't fooled around
with the paintings,

162
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,225
we probably could've reached
the fourth floor by now.

163
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,858
<i>Is that a Mimic?</i>

164
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,862
<i>I've never noticed that box there before.</i>

165
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,740
<i>It's not super obvious,
but it's not exactly hidden, either.</i>

166
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,867
<i>It's positioned in a way
that catches your eye.</i>

167
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,788
{\an8}<i>It's in a spot those bastards are fond of.</i>

168
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,084
{\an8}So, let's get some shut-eye here today.

169
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,043
{\an8}Okay.

170
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,421
{\an8}You good with that, Chilchuck?

171
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:54,880
{\an8}Sure.

172
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,469
<i>I suppose I don't have to tell them.</i>

173
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,931
<i>I just know Senshi and Laios
will insist on eating it.</i>

174
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,892
<i>Then, it'll be up to me to open the box.</i>

175
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,062
{\an8}<i>Mimics...</i>

176
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,691
{\an8}<i>I've lost count of the times
those bastards have caused me misery!</i>

177
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:15,901
All right!

178
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,862
It doesn't have a lock or a trap!

179
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,703
Since this was locked, it's not a Mimic!

180
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,338
If I open it from behind,
it shouldn't be able to hurt me!

181
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,844
Dammit! I forgot about the trap!

182
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,350
<i>Damn Mimics!</i>

183
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,519
You okay?

184
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,022
You seemed lost in thought.

185
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,982
Is something bothering you?

186
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,026
No, not really.

187
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,903
You must be tired.

188
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,279
You're still a child, after all.

189
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,823
Let him have a good night's sleep
without having to stand guard.

190
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,284
Like I said, I'm not a kid!

191
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,286
So, how old are you?

192
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,537
I'd rather not say.

193
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,832
There you go again.
You're always like that.

194
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,543
You won't even tell us
your hometown or your birthday.

195
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,838
I prefer to keep my job
and personal life in separate lanes.

196
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,217
{\an8}One of these days, you'll miss out
if you keep acting that way.

197
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,968
{\an8}Sure, whatever.

198
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,852
<i>I've become more sensitive to hunger.</i>

199
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,063
<i>I used to be fine
without food for two days.</i>

200
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,651
<i>I'll go and fetch some water
from the next room.</i>

201
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,070
Hey, slowpoke.

202
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,074
I'm going to draw some water.

203
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,911
I'll go with you.

204
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,538
Don't bother. I'll be right back.

205
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,831
It's dangerous.

206
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,041
It's just the next room.

207
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,138
<i>A Coin Bug.</i>

208
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,140
<i>I wonder if there's a nest nearby.</i>

209
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,852
<i>If I can find a few more,
it might help ease our hunger.</i>

210
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,940
<i>Not to sound like Laios,
but I kinda like Coin Bugs.</i>

211
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,235
<i>They're monsters
that camouflage like Mimics,</i>

212
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,236
<i>but they're cute.</i>

213
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,487
Hey!

214
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,823
Wait a minute, that's where the Mimic...

215
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,286
<i>You idiot.</i>

216
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,497
<i>You forgot you're heavier
with the water bag.</i>

217
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,333
<i>There should be a mechanism nearby
to open this door.</i>

218
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,004
<i>Of course, it's out of reach.</i>

219
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,214
{\an8}<i>Should I call for help?</i>

220
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,719
{\an8}<i>If my yelling attracts more monsters,
it will put my friends in danger.</i>

221
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,678
{\an8}<i>Don't worry.</i>

222
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,097
{\an8}<i>If I don't return, Marcille will notice.</i>

223
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,808
<i>Will she? No, she probably won't.</i>

224
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,934
<i>I can't count on her!</i>

225
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,228
<i>Don't panic!</i>

226
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,355
<i>Opening closed doors</i>

227
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,524
<i>is your job, isn't it?</i>

228
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,361
<i>This type of door opens
once you figure out its mechanism.</i>

229
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,406
<i>I'll be safe
as long as I don't touch the Mimic.</i>

230
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>I don't hear
any strange device making noise,</i>

231
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,368
<i>so there's no time limit, either.</i>

232
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,871
<i>There are a couple of buttons on the wall</i>

233
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,249
<i>and a mechanism
that likely triggers spears to pop up.</i>

234
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,877
<i>If I press the buttons in the wrong order,
they probably spring up.</i>

235
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,465
<i>And the text on this plate
is likely the key, but...</i>

236
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,010
<i>It's in some ancient language,
and I can't make heads or tails of it.</i>

237
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,554
<i>Darn it, if only Marcille were around.</i>

238
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>But it seems strangely familiar...</i>

239
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,062
<i>Nah, I should get my
thoughts in order first.</i>

240
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,106
<i>There are three buttons
in the corners of the room.</i>

241
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,358
<i>Why three?</i>

242
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,693
<i>Do I need to press them
in a specific sequence?</i>

243
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,407
<i>There's a button behind the Mimic as well!</i>

244
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,619
<i>Darn it! That bastard
is set on hindering me at every turn!</i>

245
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,663
<i>Could there be a hint inside the room?</i>

246
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,332
<i>Of course not.</i>

247
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,710
<i>Even if I press the buttons randomly,
I'll only end up getting skewered.</i>

248
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,380
<i>But since I'm small,
maybe I could dodge them.</i>

249
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,548
<i>Nah, it's too risky.</i>

250
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,594
<i>Ugh, I have no idea what to do!</i>

251
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:18,394
{\an8}<i>Maybe I should just
stay still until dawn...</i>

252
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,856
You were in here?!

253
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,026
Darn...

254
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,492
Ow.

255
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,619
I-I was saved...

256
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,004
You sure are tough!

257
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>Mimics are cute when you turn them over,
and they wiggle their legs.</i>

258
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,511
<i>You can tell their sex
by turning them over.</i>

259
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,515
<i>Laios' useless trivia
is coming back to me one after another!</i>

260
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,309
Turn them over?

261
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,145
As if that's possible!

262
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,648
<i>Here goes nothing!</i>

263
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,953
Ow.

264
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,664
I wonder if they're on their way
to help me after all that commotion.

265
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,791
Huh?

266
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,418
So this one was empty?

267
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,794
How dare you mock me like that!

268
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,337
Huh?

269
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,630
This text...

270
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,176
So this is what was written on the plate!

271
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,887
In that case, I know what it says!

272
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,430
Hurry!

273
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,432
-East!
-<i>No matter how many times the sun rises...</i>

274
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,933
-West!
-<i>And the moon sinks...</i>

275
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,810
-North!
-<i>Like the unmoving stars...</i>

276
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,354
South!

277
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,234
<i>May the wind of fortune
forever blow your way!</i>

278
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,446
It opened!

279
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,713
Chilchuck isn't coming back!

280
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,804
C-Chilchuck!

281
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,431
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

282
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,141
I'm alive, okay?

283
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,185
What's this?

284
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,395
Did you do this, Chilchuck?

285
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,688
Well done!

286
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,065
Sure.

287
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,526
What a fine Mimic.

288
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,820
A Mimic, huh?

289
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,571
It's going to be my first time cooking it.

290
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,366
Don't try to eat it
as if it's the normal thing to do!

291
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,827
Don't worry, Marcille.

292
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,870
Mimics on their own aren't poisonous.

293
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,124
They can be toxic depending on their diet,

294
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,044
but if you remove their digestive organs,
it should be safe.

295
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,589
How is that supposed to be safe?

296
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,092
Forget it, Marcille.

297
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,761
There's no point in telling them not to.

298
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,682
{\an8}But today, I won't eat it, no matter what!

299
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,021
Boil plenty of water,

300
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,482
add some salt.

301
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,153
Place the Mimic inside,
cover it with a lid,

302
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,029
and wait a while.

303
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,092
When it's boiled enough,

304
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,303
{\an8}it's done!

305
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,930
{\an8}BOILED MIMIC

306
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,353
It's hard to scoop out the meat.

307
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,189
How about using the handle instead?

308
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,861
It's no good.
I'm only pushing it deeper inside.

309
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,904
Right.

310
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,865
Chilchuck, let me use those things.

311
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,824
Those things?

312
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,661
{\an8}You know, the picking tools
you're always carrying around.

313
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,122
{\an8}<i>Picking tools.</i>

314
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,336
A-Are you out of your mind?

315
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,380
{\an8}It should be fine
if we disinfect them in boiling water.

316
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,719
That's not the problem!

317
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,471
D-Don't!

318
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,478
It's easy to scoop now!

319
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,689
Here.

320
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,745
It's really good.

321
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,084
This is really tasty.

322
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,921
I bet it would be delicious to eat
the back meat and leg meat together.

323
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,216
It wasn't as good as I thought.

324
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,594
They say the digestive gland
of hermit crabs tastes bad.

325
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,849
But why didn't you tell us
about the Mimic?

326
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,144
{\an8}I have unpleasant memories
associated with Mimics.

327
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,356
{\an8}Ideally, I'd like to steer clear
of them entirely.

328
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,484
Anyway, I've made
quite a few errors in judgment.

329
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,990
I panicked thinking
it might eat the Treasure Bug.

330
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,575
Mimics don't eat Treasure Bugs.

331
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,493
What?

332
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,538
<i>On the contrary,
Treasure Bugs feed on Mimics.</i>

333
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,956
<i>When they find a Mimic,</i>

334
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>they enter the box through the crack
and lay their eggs.</i>

335
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,379
<i>And the larvae that hatch inside the box
grow as they consume the Mimic.</i>

336
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,339
<i>Once they become adult insects,</i>

337
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,758
<i>they're often confused
for treasure by humans,</i>

338
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,094
<i>and they take flight
to begin their next phase of life.</i>

339
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,555
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

340
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,765
{\an8}Cut it out, will you?

341
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,601
{\an8}That's what you get
for not telling me your age.

342
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,897
{\an8}Didn't you learn that you can miss out
when you keep secrets from your friends?

343
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,775
{\an8}Come on, tell me how old you are!

344
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,820
Th...

345
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:02,988
"Th..."?

346
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,992
This year, I turn 29.

347
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,914
So you really are a kid. How boring!

00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,417
I didn't know you were so young.

349
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,669
Well, why don't you
tell me your ages, then!

350
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,130
This is what I hate
about long-lived races!

351
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,467
What?

352
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,136
Um, Mister... Chilchuck...

353
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,387
Stop it!

354
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,474
<i>Today, you feast on a monster,</i>

355
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,769
<i>but tomorrow,
you could end up as someone's meal.</i>

356
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,979
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

357
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,565
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>
