1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,814
While you guys were turning
to stone, bleeding from your nose,

3
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,733
and getting engrossed in hunting for food,

4
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,070
I managed to find some patterns
in the shifts of the dungeon.

5
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,572
It's not like I wanted
to be turned to stone.

6
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,782
Hear, hear!

7
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,326
The past three days
have been very productive!

8
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,452
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,580
One path gets blocked
and another one opens up.

10
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,457
It's basically this on repeat.

11
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,837
The number of doors, furniture,
and types of buildings stay the same.

12
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,339
A house never transforms into a graveyard.

13
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,843
The walls move in a clockwise spiral
at regular intervals.

14
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,429
The positions of the stone statues
and the directions they face are fixed.

15
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,348
Based on all that and more...

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,146
I remember this street.

17
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,982
That's the house where we ate the Dragon.

18
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,067
Chilchuck, you're a genius!

19
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,069
Well, it's all in a day's work.

20
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,823
But this street...

21
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,867
<i>Exactly.</i>

22
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,952
<i>It's where we lost Falin.</i>

23
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,872
<i>There was a pool of blood
and traces of something being dragged.</i>

24
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,831
<i>It's Falin!</i>

25
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,333
<i>If those two catch sight of it,
they'll get worked up for sure.</i>

26
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,127
<i>How am I going to make them stay calm?</i>

27
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,378
Laios, look!

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,755
What is this?

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,550
Listen! I get that there's a lot
to be concerned about,

30
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,428
but for now, let's focus
on getting back to the surface and...

31
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,263
Huh?

32
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,646
The Dragon's carcass was here, right?

33
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,857
It's vanished, without a trace.

34
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:17,030
But this crack in the wall must've been
made when the Red Dragon fell.

35
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,991
But even this crack is being repaired...

36
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,372
The magician's eye will be upon you.

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,668
Don't yell like that!

38
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,587
Just now, I saw...

39
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,467
I think it's mana sickness again.

40
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,635
Again?

41
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:43,097
Ever since I used healing magic,
I sometimes see and hear things.

42
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,474
You hear things?

43
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,476
Are you sure it's mana sickness?

44
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,810
What did you hear?

45
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,730
"The magician's eye will be upon you."

46
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,523
"The magician's eye"?

47
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,734
Could it be...

48
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,615
The sound of wings!

49
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,991
It's that Little Dragon!

50
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,117
We need to hide!

51
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,661
Hide where exactly?

52
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,746
This place is too exposed.

53
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,748
We've got to run, Marcille!

54
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,625
No, I know where to hide.

55
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,586
Inside the wall!

56
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,841
Come on, you two! Hurry!

57
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,134
Is this...

58
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,387
Another one of her spells?

59
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,781
Marcille, what kind of magic was that?

60
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,953
Cleaners?

61
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,371
What?

62
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,872
Dungeon Cleaners.

63
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,041
They're creatures, I think,

64
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,420
that keep the dungeon clean
and fix up any damages.

65
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,337
Exactly.

66
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,049
{\an8}I figured this wall
wasn't completely set yet.

67
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,427
Up until this point is the original wall,

68
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,721
and from here on are Cleaners.

69
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,930
Even the floor!

70
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:06,848
Check it out!

71
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,726
Even the wear and tear
and tiny scratches are being recreated.

72
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,103
You can't tell the difference by sight.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,315
Ugh!

74
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,818
There are tiny things
crawling all over the floor!

75
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,819
Gross!

76
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,238
{\an8}They're all Cleaners.

77
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,575
{\an8}Any dungeon without them
would fall apart in no time.

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,077
They're not monsters and aren't harmful.

79
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,746
They are harmful.

80
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,082
These suckers often nibble on my tent.

81
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,963
<i>They break down anything
they think is in the way.</i>

82
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,842
<i>They must've come to eat the remains
of the Dragon and the explosion.</i>

83
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,553
They show up when the dungeon is damaged,

84
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,598
and their secretion prevents fires
from spreading and further collapses.

85
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,018
Then they start devouring
any scattered rubble.

86
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,352
They're not picky eaters.

87
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,190
Finally, they excrete secretions
to fill in the broken areas

88
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,817
and restore the dungeon
to its former state.

89
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,987
It's similar to how creatures heal.

90
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,489
All things considered,

91
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,575
monsters act like the immune system,
clearing out germs.

92
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,868
Who are you calling germs?

93
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,579
Is that also magic at work?

94
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,872
Pretty cool, huh?

95
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,248
Good grief.

96
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,793
What's next, a magical digestive system?

97
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,463
I wonder what the dungeon
would eat in that case?

98
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,717
<i>Thank goodness the bloodstains are gone.</i>

99
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,427
{\an8}Hey.

100
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,763
{\an8}Let's get moving
before the dungeon shifts again.

101
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,722
Right.

102
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,697
{\an8}Stairs!

103
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,992
{\an8}Finally, a way out.

104
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,538
Well then, how about
we start preparing that?

105
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,165
Good idea. Let's do that.

106
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,583
That?

107
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,585
Oh, you mean that.

108
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,138
Huh? By that, you meant a meal?

109
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,723
I don't think there are
any Tentacles on this level.

110
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,142
You should've said earlier!

111
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,935
You actually like that outfit, don't you?

112
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,894
I don't!

113
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,568
We've got so many ingredients,
I'm not sure what to make.

114
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,279
Maybe I can try using that.

115
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,322
Cook up some grain.

116
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,408
Is it the stuff from the third floor?

117
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,245
I was saving it
for when we ran out of food.

118
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,914
Chop up some Cockatrice meat,

119
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,791
Dryad fruit,

120
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,418
Mandrake fruit and leaves,

121
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,671
and depetrification herbs,

122
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,174
Season them and sauté.

123
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,677
Spread a layer of cooked grain
inside hollowed-out bricks.

124
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,930
Add the toppings
and heat them, brick and all.

125
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,932
And...

126
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,809
Huh? What's that?

127
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,686
A Cockatrice egg.

128
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,940
I brought one along,

129
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,443
but it's been a bit tricky to use.

130
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,698
Finally, pour on the egg sauce and

131
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,116
{\an8}it's ready.

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,702
{\an8}STONE-BAKED COCKATRICE
CHICKEN AND EGG WITH SAUCE

133
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,496
Wow, what is this?

134
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,622
It looks delicious!

135
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,460
<i>If I'd stayed petrified,
would they have used me to make this dish?</i>

136
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,342
The scorched grain is nice!

137
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,386
Try digging your spoon into the dish.

138
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,352
I used bricks made from Dungeon Cleaners.

139
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,812
So we can even eat the dish?

140
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,149
Thanks, Senshi!

141
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,988
What does it taste like?

142
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,324
At first, it tastes like dirt.

143
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,909
But as you savor it,

144
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,204
it's like this magical blend
of green caterpillar, iron, and lemon.

145
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,790
You're just comparing it to other things.

146
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,793
There's no other way to describe it.

147
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,712
Are you sure it's safe
to eat magical creatures?

148
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,382
It might make you hear things
and bleed from your nose again.

149
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,592
I wonder what's with those hallucinations.

150
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,721
When we get back to town,
you should really see a doctor

151
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,639
for your head.

152
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,640
A doctor?

153
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,017
Do you think it's some kind of illness?

154
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,150
Is this another hallucination?

155
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,027
Are you guys seeing this?

156
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,655
I-I see it.

157
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,658
I mean, we're...

158
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,868
under attack!

159
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,792
Huh? What on earth?

160
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,419
It's just frog skin.

161
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,048
Looks like these horns
are just decorations on a helmet.

162
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,883
A child?

163
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,930
Some monsters
disguise themselves as humans.

164
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:02,310
Let's try killing one to see
if they'll reveal their true colors...

165
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,228
Don't, Maizuru.

166
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,358
I know them.

167
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,610
-Shuro!
-Shuro!

168
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,738
{\an8}Shuro, long time no see!

169
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,491
What a pleasant surprise
to run into you here!

170
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,243
Did you lose weight?

171
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,628
Thanks, Shuro!

172
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,048
Glad to see you're doing well.

173
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,883
Goodness! How forward of him!

174
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,468
Oh, let me introduce you.

175
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,428
This is Senshi.

176
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,890
Senshi, meet Shuro,
our former party member.

177
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,850
{\an8}Shuro? Who's that?

178
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,019
{\an8}They probably mean Young Master Toshiro.

179
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,647
Toshuro?

180
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,109
Let's continue
our conversation sitting down.

181
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,195
We were just having a meal.

182
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,656
Would you all like to...

183
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,743
Huh? You've got quite a big group!

184
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,162
Hey, Kabru.

185
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,330
Is that...

186
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,917
Nice to meet you.

187
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,045
You're Laios, aren't you?

188
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,964
Yeah.

189
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,299
Nice to meet you.

190
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,805
How long has it been?

191
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,557
Hey, Kabru.

192
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,393
It's them, right?

193
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,186
The ones who stole our stuff.

194
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,729
What will you do?

195
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,690
Nothing.

196
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,608
Huh?

197
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,819
What did we come all the way here for?

198
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,033
I wanted to meet them.

199
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,368
Huh?

200
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,579
<i>I doubt asking them
about the treasure will help.</i>

201
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,833
<i>He didn't look guilty even when he saw us.</i>

202
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,878
{\an8}Either he doesn't remember,
or we're mistaken.

203
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,673
{\an8}Or maybe the treasure itself was a trap.

204
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,341
{\an8}Or maybe all of them.

205
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,260
{\an8}Are you saying
we made this trip for nothing?

206
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,469
{\an8}Don't be hasty.

207
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,138
{\an8}Give me a bit more time.

208
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,391
Don't you want to find out
how they managed to get here

209
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,811
and what they plan to do in the future?

210
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,566
So, you've been
on this level for a while now?

211
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,525
Yeah.

212
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,777
<i>We kept going around in circles,</i>

213
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,779
<i>and when we got out,
we were back at the entrance.</i>

214
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,532
<i>We got lost a lot too.</i>

215
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,785
But Chilchuck
found patterns in the shifts,

216
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,121
and that's how we finally made it here.

217
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,038
I see.

218
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,041
Anyway, Shuro, you...

219
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,463
You lech!

220
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,173
Are they the connections you mentioned?

221
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,299
Lucky you!

222
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,260
They're just retainers.

223
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,762
{\an8}They're quite skilled, though.

224
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,891
{\an8}I'm sorry for leaving the party.

225
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,936
{\an8}But when I realized Falin
was missing up on the surface,

226
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,026
I thought this was the best way
to get back into the dungeon and find her.

227
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,320
Forgive me.

228
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,322
It's fine. There was no other way.

229
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,534
But I'm surprised you went back
into the dungeon right after that.

230
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,203
Wasn't it a little rash?

231
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,664
What would you have done
if someone got hurt again?

232
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,084
Just so you know,

233
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,339
the four of us
even defeated the Red Dragon!

234
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,340
What?!

235
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,050
The Red Dragon?

236
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,844
A-And what about her?

237
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,349
Shuro!

238
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,266
Young Master!

239
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,395
{\an8}I beg you, please eat and get some sleep!

240
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,523
{\an8}At this rate, your body will break down!

241
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,733
You're pushing yourself that hard?

242
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,486
Look at how gaunt he is.
You should've noticed.

243
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,114
You should get food and sleep, you know.

244
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,785
I don't have time for that.

245
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,664
{\an8}Shuro, eating isn't something
you do when you have time.

246
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,875
It's only after having sleep and food

247
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,087
that creatures can
finally do what they want.

248
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,006
Have something to eat.

249
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,051
While you do, I'll fill you in
on what happened.

250
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,638
Fine.

251
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,891
Can you prepare something, Maizuru?

252
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,564
A meal! Prepare a meal!

253
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,941
Tade, go fetch some water!

254
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,067
On it!

255
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,779
Hien, Benichidori, get ready to cook rice.

256
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,865
Asebi, you...

257
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,286
guard the Young Master.

258
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,705
I don't want anything strange
mixed into the food.

259
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,708
Well then, I'll get the fire going.

260
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,459
You are considerate.

261
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,044
I'll leave it to you, dwarf.

262
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,464
A meal, a meal!

263
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,466
This group is too big.

264
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,720
It's not safe for so many people
to gather in one place.

265
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,889
Let's split up into three.

266
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,725
In that case,

267
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,102
Rin, dwarf,

268
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,562
frog woman!

269
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,479
What?!

270
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,816
Everyone who can use magic,
put up a barrier.

271
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,445
Make sure no monsters disturb
the Young Master while he eats.

272
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,365
Let's work together, young lady.

273
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,200
R-Right.

274
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,952
Okay then,

275
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,079
Shuro, let's step away too.

276
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,498
I'll give you a quick rundown.

277
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:17,958
I'll help support him.

278
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:18,876
Thanks.

279
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,253
There's so much to do!

280
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,257
<i>In this case,
who's more dangerous if left alone?</i>

281
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,636
Monsters! Delicious! Awesome!

282
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,972
Monsters! Cook! Eat!

283
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,098
Eat this!

284
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,642
Die.

285
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,394
{\an8}Senshi, I'm coming with you!

286
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,410
Hey, aren't you overdoing it?

287
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,536
The smoke...

288
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,499
After this meal,
I must make him take a bath.

289
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,541
<i>Here?</i>

290
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,086
Okay, Shuro, sit here.

291
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,505
Never mind that,
just tell me what happened.

292
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,300
After you and Namari left, we...

293
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,635
Just give me the gist.

294
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,807
We defeated the Red Dragon,
retrieved Falin, and revived her.

295
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,434
But on our way back,
we were attacked by the lunatic magician,

296
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,727
and we lost her.

297
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,064
There was nothing more
we could do on our own,

298
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,651
{\an8}so we decided to head back
to the surface and ask for backup.

299
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,361
{\an8}But we got lost and...

300
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,281
But I'm glad we
crossed paths with you, Shuro!

301
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,200
Will you help us out?

302
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,288
Um, can I ask something?

303
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,168
The lunatic magician is the one
who created this dungeon, right?

304
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,422
<i>There are rumors and whispers about him,</i>

305
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,091
<i>but no one who's seen him
has ever returned.</i>

306
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,260
How can you be sure it was him?

307
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,845
Huh?

308
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,597
Well, he sounded and acted like it.

309
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,851
And how did you manage to escape?

310
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,310
It was thanks to Marcille...

311
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,856
The mage in our party protected us.

312
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,107
How exactly?

313
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,817
Um...

314
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,446
Magic isn't my area of expertise,
so I'm not sure.

315
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,573
I see.

316
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,577
I have a question too.

317
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,170
Why were you munching on a brick?

318
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,671
Huh?

319
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,381
Oh, it's not what it seems.

320
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,674
That wasn't a brick.

321
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,343
It was part of a wall
made from Dungeon Cleaners.

322
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,347
We left all our food
and money behind, right?

323
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:42,186
So to get down into the dungeon faster,
we fed on monsters along the way.

324
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,486
That...

325
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,615
is just hilarious!

326
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,532
Huh?

327
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,743
What was the tastiest thing
you've eaten so far?

328
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,994
You want to know?

329
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,245
That's a tough one.

330
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,164
{\an8}Kelpie, Living Armor...

331
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,249
{\an8}No, it's got to be the Red Dragon!

332
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,211
{\an8}You ate the Red Dragon
that ate your sister?

333
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,462
{\an8}Yeah.

334
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,131
Living Armor, though.
Are there any edible parts?

335
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,758
That's a good question!

336
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,969
Actually, it's a colony of mollusks
wearing a shell and...

337
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,262
Here, check out this sword.

338
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,015
The Cleaners are trying to eat Kensuke!

339
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,017
You just can't be too careful!

340
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,895
By the way, if you're interested
in monster cuisine,

341
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,480
I'd be happy to treat you anytime.

342
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,690
Wow, I'd love that!

343
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,902
<i>Crap. This guy will actually
take me up on it.</i>

344
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,532
So after she...

345
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,369
After Falin was revived,
was she safe the last time you saw her?

346
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,162
Yeah.

347
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,872
Any idea where she might be?

348
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,000
There are plenty of places
to hide on this level,

349
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,169
but most of them are the orcs' base camps.

350
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,880
Oh, you don't have to worry about them.

351
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,840
What?

352
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,926
What did they taste like?

353
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,010
No!

354
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,097
It's a long story,
but we're cooperating with them now.

355
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,350
Cooperating with them?

356
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,562
<i>Has he forgotten that killing them
is our duty as adventurers?</i>

357
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,064
Anyway, about Falin's whereabouts,

358
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,067
she might be somewhere
lower than this level.

359
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,028
She could have been taken there.

360
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,573
{\an8}Taken? Why?

361
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,241
{\an8}Um...

362
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,536
{\an8}<i>Is it safe to tell Shuro?</i>

363
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,956
Would you mind if I talked to him alone?

364
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,083
Sure, I'll step out.

365
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,092
So?

366
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,977
Field ration pellets aren't bad,
but having them every day?

367
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,689
Sometimes, you need something
warm in your belly.

368
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,857
I agree.

369
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,028
A meal should be more than
about filling the stomach.

370
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,071
I see you have sense, dwarf.

371
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,366
The Young Master
was often sick as a child.

372
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,495
He also had a small appetite,
which worried everyone.

373
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,792
<i>But he always had a hearty appetite
for whatever I made him.</i>

374
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,087
<i>Even during missions,
I was often sent to the kitchen.</i>

375
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,300
He was such a well-behaved child,
it made me concerned.

376
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,013
This is the first time
he's ever made a selfish request.

377
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,681
Please, Maizuru.

378
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,100
There's someone I want to save.

379
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,228
Lend me your aid.

380
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,565
I never imagined he'd become

381
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,485
infatuated with a Northern girl
on his training journey.

382
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,779
How do I convince him to move on?

383
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,281
You want him to move on?

384
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,077
I've been tasked by the lord
to care for the Young Master.

385
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,788
I can't let my emotions
dictate my actions.

386
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,291
Then why are you doing what you're doing?

387
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,380
If you have preserved foods,
you don't have to bother with cooking.

388
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,551
I know why he had an appetite
for your cooking only.

389
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,888
I know what you put into them.

390
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,806
Huh?

391
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,767
It was love.

392
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,813
What is that supposed to mean?

393
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,648
Were you trying to be clever?

394
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,987
But yes, I suppose
it's a little too late now.

395
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,572
Depending on how things turn out,

396
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,075
perhaps I can speak on his behalf.

397
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,952
{\an8}TSUGUYOSHI NAKAMOTO

398
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,078
{\an8}TOSHITSUGU NAKAMOTO

399
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,663
{\an8}NOW, TOSHIRO NAKAMOTO

400
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,872
{\an8}FALIRO NAKAMOTO

401
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,833
{\an8}It's using different art materials!

402
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,711
{\an8}I don't think that's likely just yet.

403
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,588
Good. This will do.

404
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,007
{\an8}It's ready.

405
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,592
{\an8}AN EASTERN MEAL

406
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,596
Now then, let us serve it while it's hot!

407
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,476
What are you two doing here?

408
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,437
They wanted to talk privately.

409
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,815
Young Master, I'm coming in.

410
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,026
Young Master!

411
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,778
What happened?

412
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,823
Did this man try something?

413
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,702
Well? What happened?!

414
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,038
Sorry. We don't know.

415
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,999
Black magic.

416
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:18,879
This man used black magic
to revive a woman using monster flesh.

417
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,130
Black...?

418
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,009
How could you?

419
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,386
Do you even realize what you've done?

420
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,930
Anyone involved with black magic,

421
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,893
no matter their motives
or degree of magic, is a serious criminal!

422
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,687
They're locked up
in the dark until they die,

423
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,439
and even their corpses never return.

424
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,735
If the elves of the west find out,
who knows what will happen to her?

425
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,988
{\an8}That is, if word
gets out from this dungeon.

426
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,492
{\an8}And I know you will
never tell anyone about this.

427
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,119
Right?

428
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,709
It was the only way.

429
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,753
Please understand, Shuro.

430
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,007
<i>Black magic?</i>

431
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,094
<i>This is way worse than I thought.</i>

432
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,470
<i>What's going to happen now?</i>

433
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,995
Lord Delgal...

434
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,041
I must find him.

435
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,968
