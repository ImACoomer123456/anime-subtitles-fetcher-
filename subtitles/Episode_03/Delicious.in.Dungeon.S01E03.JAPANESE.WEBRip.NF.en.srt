1
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,938
I'm so tired.

3
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,189
All these stairs...

4
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,191
doesn't it feel like
you're twice as tired?

5
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,194
A moderate amount of fatigue
makes your meal taste better.

6
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,987
In moderation, sure.

7
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,449
Give me your sword.

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,826
Sure.

9
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,956
There should be a trick door around here.

10
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,804
I almost forgot that the door led here.

11
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,764
It saved us quite a bit of time.

12
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,643
Huh?

13
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,353
What is it?

14
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,690
The decoration on my sword guard is gone.

15
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,109
It's because you were reckless with it.

16
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,069
Was it my fault?

17
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,656
No, it was coming loose for a while now.

18
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>I was trying to hold it together
with string or glue,</i>

19
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,745
<i>but I guess it was time.</i>

20
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,832
{\an8}Is there a problem if it's gone?

21
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,458
{\an8}Nope. Not at all.

22
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,587
{\an8}Was it a memento or something?

23
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,548
{\an8}A memento... I suppose you could say that.

24
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,719
<i>Three years ago,
when I was just a beginner,</i>

25
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,180
<i>I joined a gold-peeling crew
to get some experience.</i>

26
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,099
<i>Gold-peeling?</i>

27
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,477
<i>A long time ago, this castle
was completely covered in gold,</i>

28
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,354
<i>and peeling it made quite a profit.</i>

29
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,276
This place has been
mostly peeled already.

30
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,987
Let's see if there's anything
inside the castle.

31
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,155
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

32
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:21,534
Laios, isn't it dangerous for us to enter
the castle with our current abilities?

33
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:25,330
Yeah, but the two of us
can't turn back on our own.

34
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,338
What the hell?

35
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,797
How awful.

36
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,758
It's completely rotten away.

37
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,010
I guess that's what happens
if you die in here.

38
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,887
No one finds you.

39
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,765
Hey! Come over here!

40
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,066
You could probably sell these.

41
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,692
They're better than what we saw earlier,

42
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,153
but you can only melt them down
and sell them for ingredients...

43
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,532
T-The armor moved!

44
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,284
It's a monster! Run!

45
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,788
We're no match for it. Run!

46
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,004
You...!

47
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,885
D-Dammit!

48
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,136
My sword...

49
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,481
Come on...!

50
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,574
I did it!

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,994
{\an8}-Laios!
-Huh?

52
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,500
<i>Something like that happened.</i>

53
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,086
And this is the sword I got then.

54
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,379
So you lost...

55
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,967
It was my first death, so for a while,
simply seeing an armor terrified me.

56
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,681
I read a lot of documents,
but none of them described how they taste.

57
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,350
I wonder what they taste like.

58
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,395
Senshi, how would you cook them?

59
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,523
Armor isn't edible.

60
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:20,028
Living Armor is simply controlled
by magic, and it's not some creature.

61
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,988
I-I know that, but...

62
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,990
What about the leather clasps?

63
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,451
{\an8}It's difficult to eat tanned hide,

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,288
{\an8}and it's far easier
to catch other monsters.

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,042
If you're that hungry for armor,
cook and eat your own.

66
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,128
I see.

67
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,672
I guess we can't eat Living Armor.

68
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,300
Come on, let's go.

69
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,014
{\an8}I'd rather not fight them now.

70
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,016
{\an8}How about running our way past them?

71
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,020
{\an8}They're slow,
so we could easily shake them off.

72
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,229
{\an8}True.

73
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,274
{\an8}Are you all okay with that?

74
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,400
{\an8}Sure.

75
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,903
We don't know
which set of armor might move.

76
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,404
Everyone, be careful.

77
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,405
Ready?

78
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,462
H-Here comes!

79
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,096
Run!

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,210
Our way is completely blocked!

81
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,711
What the heck?

82
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,589
{\an8}H-Hey! This is bad!

83
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,967
{\an8}Let's turn back for now and regroup!

84
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,094
{\an8}Pull back!

85
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,772
They're especially persistent today.

86
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,150
I wonder if something
put them in a bad mood.

87
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,109
No way!

88
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,446
{\an8}They don't have
physical conditions or feelings.

89
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,867
{\an8}That's why it should be easy if we can
defeat whoever is controlling them.

90
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,244
Are you sure there's someone?

91
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,495
I've never seen them.

92
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,248
USUALLY

93
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,710
<i>Usually, they only attack anyone
who gets close to them.</i>

94
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,505
<i>But today, they clearly blocked our path.</i>

95
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,303
<i>In other words, maybe they're
guarding something that's farther ahead.</i>

96
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,973
Whoever is controlling them is close by?

97
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,143
You're right. That might be possible.

98
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,937
{\an8}What? Is it a monster?

99
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,189
{\an8}I don't know.

100
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,817
{\an8}But a magic-user with such power
can't be anyone decent!

101
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,739
{\an8}Anyway, we have to find a way
to get past that barrier of armor and...

102
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,826
{\an8}So, if we can reach the magic-user
who is controlling the Living Armor,

103
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,746
we might be able to stop them.

104
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,289
But how?

105
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,415
For example...

106
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,126
Three of us act as bait
to draw their attention

107
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,504
while one of us goes past the door.

108
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,592
Good luck.

109
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,803
I thought you might be
the most fitting for the role

110
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,931
since you're good at going unnoticed.

111
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,933
I'm no good in combat.

112
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,269
Besides, Living Armor
doesn't have eyes or ears,

113
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,272
so going unnoticed doesn't help much
against something that's not alive.

114
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,025
Doesn't have eyes or ears...

115
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,074
Are you ready?

116
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,327
All right! Let's go!

117
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,828
Come on!

118
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,207
Gather around us, you sets of armor!

119
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,417
They're all coming!

120
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,710
Don't panic!

121
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,846
<i>Aslam!</i>

122
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,875
What? There's another Living Armor here?

123
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,300
<i>I've never seen this type of armor move.</i>

124
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,928
<i>I don't see anyone
who's controlling it, though.</i>

125
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,931
<i>It looks stronger
than the armor back there.</i>

126
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,145
<i>I can't call for backup, though.</i>

127
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,482
<i>Anyway, I have to figure out on my own
what they're guarding.</i>

128
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>I'll cut off its arm or leg</i>

129
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,492
<i>and render it immobile!</i>

130
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,725
Dammit! You...!

131
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,278
<i>Why did it guard its shield?</i>

132
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,489
<i>What's that?</i>

133
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,743
<i>There's something on its shield.</i>

134
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,747
{\an8}<i>Somehow, it seems very familiar.</i>

135
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,755
<i>Right.</i>

136
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,885
<i>It's...</i>

137
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,142
<i>An egg case!</i>

138
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,853
<i>It's an egg of some creature.</i>

139
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,896
<i>That's what it shielded!</i>

140
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,068
<i>But what egg could it be?</i>

141
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,737
<i>Is it the egg of whoever
is controlling the armor?</i>

142
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,116
<i>Besides, Living Armor
doesn't have eyes or ears.</i>

143
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,325
<i>That's not it!</i>

144
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,910
<i>It's been bugging me all this time.</i>

145
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,496
<i>They're inorganic, without eyes or ears.</i>

146
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,749
<i>The way they pick up their head
and put it back on.</i>

147
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,336
<i>The way they turn their head
and follow our movements.</i>

148
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,839
<i>And the egg...</i>

149
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,717
<i>There's no doubt about it!
They're living creatures!</i>

150
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,679
<i>No one is giving them orders.</i>

151
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:06,559
<i>They're simply acting on their instincts
and trying to protect the egg.</i>

152
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,646
<i>In that case,
there are many ways to defeat them!</i>

153
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:12,940
<i>And...</i>

154
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>they're edible!</i>

155
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,034
This is endless!

156
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,287
Are you serious?!

157
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,083
Don't pause! It's dangerous if you freeze!

158
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,418
Senshi! Behind you!

159
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,295
<i>Aslam!</i>

160
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,756
Huh? Hey!

161
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,263
Do they share parts?

162
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,181
What?!

163
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,807
Is that even possible?!

164
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
Hey, Laios!

165
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,771
Do something about these armors quickly!

166
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,276
<i>These Living Armors don't die
even when you cut off their heads.</i>

167
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,945
<i>But if they're creatures,
they must be killable.</i>

168
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:05,451
<i>Either by internal injury, outflow
of body fluid, suffocation, or starvation.</i>

169
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,370
<i>It's not realistic to try a method
that takes time.</i>

170
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,291
<i>First, I need to determine
the form of the creature that is inside.</i>

171
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,839
<i>For an amorphous creature like a Slime,
its movements are too rigid.</i>

172
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,219
<i>Is it possible that they're swarms
of tiny creatures?</i>

173
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,638
<i>But they don't make any sound,
so that seems unlikely.</i>

174
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>Or maybe creatures with long limbs
are controlling them from inside.</i>

175
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,895
<i>They could be other creatures,</i>

176
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,398
<i>but it's probably easier
to see for myself.</i>

177
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,026
<i>It doesn't seem like
I can match it in strength.</i>

178
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,736
<i>In that case,</i>

179
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,738
<i>I only have one option!</i>

180
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,783
<i>Go for the shield with the egg attached,
and make it drop its guard!</i>

181
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,254
Got it!

182
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,882
What's inside? Huh?

183
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,134
There's nothing!

184
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,721
It's empty.

185
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,141
Could it have been a camouflage tactic
when it retrieved its head?

186
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,644
<i>This is bad.</i>

187
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,896
{\an8}I need... I need to think of my next move!

188
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,526
What?

189
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>Couldn't it see which pillar I hid behind?</i>

190
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,241
<i>There must be something in its head, then.</i>

191
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,618
A gap?

192
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,590
I see. It was a mollusk!

193
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,800
It was clinging to the inside.

194
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,136
<i>Could it have survived amputation</i>

195
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,680
<i>because it was a colony
of many creatures to begin with?</i>

196
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,433
<i>Is it looking for its head?</i>

197
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,977
<i>Maybe in its current state...</i>

198
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,330
Hmm, how interesting!

199
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,956
Just how many are there?

200
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,793
They mimic muscle movements

201
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,671
by expanding
and contracting at the joints.

202
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,757
I wonder if they're hermaphrodites.

203
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,801
I wonder which creature laid the egg.

204
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,847
I forgot I don't have time
for this right now!

205
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,350
Excuse me!

206
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,227
You...! Just let go!

207
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,355
Everyone! Come over here now!

208
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,731
-Now's not the time!
-Now's not the time!

209
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,695
Huh?

210
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,703
What was that? How did you do that?!

211
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,582
So there was a magic-user?!

212
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,751
There were no magic-users.

213
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,837
The Living Armors weren't controlled.

214
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,297
They were creatures.

215
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,715
Huh?

216
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,051
Look at the inside of this armor.

217
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,553
There are two layers,
and something is clinging between them.

218
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,723
This is the identity of the Living Armor.

219
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,980
<i>By clasping hands inside the armor,</i>

220
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,816
<i>they were acting
as muscles of different parts.</i>

221
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,860
Even though each creature is weak,

222
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,738
by dividing the body parts
and utilizing the armor's structure,

223
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,491
they can imitate human movements.

224
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,119
Unluckily for us,

225
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,871
it seems we encountered them
during the spawning season this time.

226
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,125
Spawning?! These things hatch from eggs?!

227
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,378
That's right! They hatch from eggs!

228
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,588
{\an8}No one realized this until now!

229
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,925
{\an8}Everyone thought they were simply
Living Armor controlled by magic!

230
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,303
{\an8}If I were to reveal this fact,
it would cause a huge stir in our circle!

231
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,890
You know how he talks fast

232
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,142
when it comes to monsters?

233
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,518
It creeps me out.

234
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,395
Hush! Stop that.

235
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,646
Senshi!

236
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,899
We might not be able to eat armor,
but what about the stuff inside?

237
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,318
Looks pretty nutritious, doesn't it?

238
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,159
There's no way we can eat something
so mysterious!

239
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,286
Now, now, Marcille.

240
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,831
Every food is a mystery
until that first bite.

241
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,710
{\an8}Now's not the time to be trying it!

242
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,961
Let's give it a shot.

243
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,339
I'm using this ingredient
for the first time,

244
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,841
so I'm not confident, though.

245
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,468
Thanks, Senshi.

246
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,927
No way!

247
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,513
What if it's extremely poisonous?

248
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:41,852
I doubt a creature with potent poison
would hide itself inside a shell.

249
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,314
But how should I cook it?

250
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,232
This underside...

251
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,027
didn't budge when I tried
to pry it open with my hands.

252
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,364
But when I cut this part with a blade,
it couldn't close the gap.

253
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,701
Maybe it was an adductor muscle
that it uses to close the gap,

254
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,536
like a scallop.

255
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,872
I see. So it's a shellfish.

256
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,874
All right, I've decided.

257
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,543
Pry the meat from the armor, will you?

258
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,553
It drowned.

259
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,389
I guess you can't purge
the sand with water.

260
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,893
I don't know if they even need
to be purged of sand.

261
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,729
I'm a bit worried
about their internal organs,

262
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,397
so I'll remove them.

263
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,026
The sliced meat will go inside a soup.

264
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,573
Oil, meat from the Living Armor,
herbs, and seasoning.

265
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,328
And the head...

266
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,414
will be steamed.

267
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,168
And finally,
we might as well make the classic dish.

268
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,260
It's ready!

269
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,178
DWARF-STYLE LIVING ARMOR STIR-FRY
LIVING ARMOR SOUP

270
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,181
GRILLED LIVING ARMOR

271
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,184
{\an8}STEAM-BAKED LIVING ARMOR

272
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,603
Marcille, which do you want to have first?

273
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,604
What?

274
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,606
I-I'll have the soup, then...

275
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,610
Wait, do antidotes
work against food poisoning as well?

276
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,696
It doesn't smell bad.

277
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,240
It smells faintly of iron.

278
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,950
Laios,

279
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:20,868
here.

280
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,828
It's hot!

281
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,293
Why are you all looking at me like that?

282
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,297
{\an8}You've been craving Living Armor
for a long time now, right?

283
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,966
{\an8}We shouldn't eat it before you do.

284
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,593
I see...

285
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,595
If he dies, let's leave him here.

286
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,721
Yeah.

287
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,269
-<i>Did he die?
-Did he die?</i>

288
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,812
It's delicious!

289
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,357
What on earth? It's so delicious!

290
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,403
At first, it tasted bland,
but the flavor kicks in later!

291
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,281
How long does it take before you
start having symptoms of food poisoning?

292
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,657
It depends on the food.

293
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,747
So that's what it tastes like.

294
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,000
Not bad, but I think
I could've cooked it better.

295
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,376
How about the dish you have?

296
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,674
Well, I suppose this one should be safe
because it was stir-fried with herbs.

297
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,388
H-How is it?

298
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,557
It's not bad.

299
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,821
What do you think, Marcille?

300
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,242
It tastes a bit like mushrooms.

301
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,284
Right?

302
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,663
The steam-baked one
looks ready and tasty, too.

303
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,415
It has to taste great!

304
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,045
It tastes like mold.

305
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,756
The odor of the helmet
must've gotten trapped in it.

306
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,427
Here.

307
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,473
You know, I've been in the dungeon
for a long time now,

308
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,101
but I never thought they were edible.

309
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,230
{\an8}Nobody would expect Living Armor
to be a sort of shellfish

310
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,440
{\an8}that hatch from eggs.

311
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,111
Maybe when they're newborns
and juveniles, they're very small,

312
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,697
and no one suspects them
to be Living Armor.

313
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,700
<i>They probably form shells as they grow.</i>

314
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,201
<i>Then, they start forming colonies.</i>

315
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,830
<i>And when they can move,
they travel looking for other colonies.</i>

316
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,834
<i>Maybe the armor standing in rows
were looking for partners.</i>

317
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:38,672
<i>They are likely hermaphrodites
and the biggest colony lays an egg.</i>

318
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,842
<i>Oh! That means...</i>

319
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,635
The armor I occasionally see holding hands

320
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,512
might not have been
adventurers fooling around.

321
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,431
Maybe they were actually mating!

322
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,849
You can drop it now.

323
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,477
<i>To think the thing
I was so scared of for a time</i>

324
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,231
<i>was such a tasty and feeble monster.</i>

325
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,609
Your sword broke, huh?

326
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,987
Why don't you take that one?

327
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,075
Laios!

328
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,163
{\an8}If you're going to use that sword,
shall I test it to see if it's not cursed?

329
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,831
No need!

330
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,416
I'm absolutely sure it's not cursed!

331
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,709
I can tell!

332
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,294
You seem awfully confident.

333
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,422
Don't come to me if you end up
with some weird curse.

334
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,718
Everyone, wait for me!

335
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,263
<i>Armed with a new sword,</i>

336
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,640
<i>their journey continues.</i>

337
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,854
<i>The other three had no way of knowing</i>

338
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,815
<i>that they had a new companion.</i>

339
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,992
