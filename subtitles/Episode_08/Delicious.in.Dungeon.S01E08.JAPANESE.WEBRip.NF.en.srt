1
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,402
I overslept!

3
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,955
I can't hear his heartbeat.

4
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,958
{\an8}Of course, you can't hear it
from over his armor.

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,461
He finally managed to fall asleep
a little while ago.

6
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,966
Seems like the food poisoning symptoms
are letting up as well.

7
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,469
I see. So, I made a fuss over nothing.

8
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,555
Let him sleep a little longer.

9
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,974
It seems he was delirious
all throughout the night.

10
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,478
{\an8}You know, here in this dungeon,
even the number of monsters

11
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,856
{\an8}that are defeated by intruders
are taken into account.

12
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,816
Even when we defeat monsters,

13
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,485
we're only maintaining
the balance of the ecosystem.

14
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,823
But if we let them be,
the monsters will wander into towns.

15
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,869
And the towns will hire adventurers
to hunt the monsters.

16
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,997
It's designed so well.

17
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,124
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,751
The design of the dungeon, of course.

19
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,381
I studied it in school a long time ago.

20
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,633
But it was really tricky.

21
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,219
Hey, look.

22
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,015
That's Marcille
from the graduate school, isn't it?

23
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,684
The most brilliant female student
in the school's history!

24
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,646
I heard she assisted a teacher
on her very first day here.

25
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,108
And I heard she's already on track
to become the court mage.

26
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,110
Wow, that's amazing!

27
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,907
{\an8}I didn't start as a teacher's assistant
until my fifth day of school,

28
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,160
{\an8}and as for becoming a court mage,
it's just that my parent used to be one.

29
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,291
Today, I asked the teacher
to let me join the class.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,543
I hope we can get along.

31
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,047
-Y-Yeah!
-Y-Yeah!

32
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,551
Today, we will try
a spirit breeding experiment.

33
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,930
Everyone, take a jar each and go outside.

34
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,184
<i>Prepare wooden planks with holes in them</i>

35
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,064
<i>and place them inside a jar,
sandwiching them between layers of soil.</i>

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,192
<i>Create a barrier,</i>

37
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,196
<i>fill the jar with magic,</i>

38
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,782
<i>and release the spirits into it.</i>

39
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,704
<i>The tiny spirits live solely
on the magic inside the jar.</i>

40
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,208
<i>If the magic is too strong or too weak,
they will die.</i>

41
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>Breeding spirits is considered
the foundation of summoning magic.</i>

42
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,674
<i>Because its structure resembles that
of a dungeon that houses monsters,</i>

43
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,968
<i>it's referred to as a "dungeonium."</i>

44
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,221
When you're done,
place your jar inside the darkroom.

45
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,015
We'll check on them a week from now.

46
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,853
Wow, your barrier is so pretty, Marcille!

47
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,981
Are you sure this is your first time?

48
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,276
But why are you studying summoning magic?

49
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,987
It's not your main field of study, is it?

50
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,782
I'm researching how
to create a safe dungeon.

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,535
Right now, I'm focused
on the ingredients of magic.

52
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,495
For example,

53
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,582
<i>the way we currently gather Mandrakes
is quite dangerous.</i>

54
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,711
But if I can design a safe dungeon

55
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,755
and grow only
beneficial monsters inside it,

56
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,800
I believe I could contribute to society.

57
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,427
Wow.

58
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,012
That's so cool.

59
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,055
Check out Marcille's barrier!

60
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,348
It's so beautiful!

61
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,975
I want to see it, too!

62
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,518
Let me see!

63
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,936
Watch out!

64
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,399
{\an8}Are you okay?

65
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,026
{\an8}T-Thanks.

66
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,282
<i>The soil has impurities mixed in,</i>

67
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,785
<i>and there are many gaps in the barrier,
causing the magic to weaken.</i>

68
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,164
<i>At this rate, the spirits inside
won't be able to survive for long.</i>

69
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,167
I hope your uniform didn't get dirty.

70
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,378
That girl is always covered in mud,

71
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,173
and she keeps skipping class,
so she's always lagging behind.

72
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,806
Everyone, retrieve your jars

73
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,435
and check how many spirits
are still alive.

74
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,271
Oh no, they're all dead!

75
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,148
They're just barely alive.

76
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,858
I bred a new spirit species!

77
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,942
That's mold.

78
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,031
<i>If there are many spirits still alive,
the fire will burn strongly.</i>

79
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,203
Yours are almost in the same condition
as they were a week ago.

80
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,413
Good work.

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,380
M-My jar!

82
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,092
Your spirits have multiplied quite a lot.

83
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,927
What should I do?

84
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,137
I'll take care of it.

85
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,849
How did you manage to do that?

86
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,352
{\an8}I-I'm sorry.

87
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,688
{\an8}There's this place
that's always teeming with spirits,

88
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,858
{\an8}and I thought that using it
as a reference might work.

89
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,361
{\an8}Teeming with spirits?

90
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,612
{\an8}Where is this place?

91
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,864
{\an8}U-Um...

92
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,700
{\an8}This jar likely has just as many spirits
as you'd find in a dungeon.

93
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,537
This will make a splendid sample.

94
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,126
It's inside a real dungeon.

95
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,506
This is where I sneak outside.

96
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,759
A hidden passage?

97
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,201
Are you always doing stuff like this?

98
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,286
Yup!

99
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,040
So, that's why you're lagging behind.

100
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,510
A grasshopper!

101
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,387
Raspberries!

102
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,142
{\an8}Don't eat something so mysterious!

103
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,145
{\an8}Don't touch them, either!
They could be poisonous and dangerous!

104
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,148
T-They're not mysterious.

105
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,401
Grasshoppers and raspberries
aren't poisonous, either.

106
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,867
It's a real dungeon.

107
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,119
I've never seen one before.

108
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,249
<i>There's stagnant magic here,
and the air is still.</i>

109
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,627
<i>It's a naturally formed cave.</i>

110
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,546
Hey, it's dangerous!

111
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,303
Don't worry.

112
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,347
I come here often.

113
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,766
You'll be safe as long as you
stay on the dry ground.

114
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,162
Wow.

115
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,667
Dungeons really are teeming with spirits.

116
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,464
I took the soil and water from here
and placed them inside my jar.

117
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,425
I see.

118
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,095
What do you usually do when you come here?

119
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,599
I write letters and read books.

120
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,311
{\an8}<i>So, this is totally the result
of her slacking off.</i>

121
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,317
<i>Anyway, this place seems pretty safe.</i>

122
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,736
<i>Hold on.</i>

123
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,323
<i>If I cultivate this place
and plant Mandrakes,</i>

124
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,243
<i>I'll be able to use
the dungeon's magic safely.</i>

125
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,079
<i>Yes, it should work.</i>

126
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,498
<i>It's a good distance
from the water as well.</i>

127
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,170
S-Slime!

128
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,090
We should burn all monsters!

129
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,174
N-No!

130
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,555
What did you do that for?

131
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,977
It won't venture into a sunlit area.

132
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:11,485
{\an8}Slimes break down bat droppings
and convert them into magic.

133
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,657
Without them,
the dungeon will wither away.

134
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,911
Bats...

135
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,580
Here.

136
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,969
<i>It's good.</i>

137
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:41,682
<i>If they taste this good,
I'm sure other animals eat them, too.</i>

138
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>I wonder what the bats here eat.</i>

139
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,982
<i>When do these raspberries bear fruit?</i>

140
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,193
<i>What animals feed on them?</i>

141
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,073
<i>Without knowing that,
I won't be able to design a dungeon.</i>

142
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,996
<i>There's so much I don't know.</i>

143
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,627
Thanks for bringing me here.

144
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,925
I thought all I had to do
was study magic to improve.

145
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,511
But it seems like I was mistaken.

146
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,682
By the way, um...

147
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,436
I'm Falin. What's your name?

148
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,279
I'm Marcille.

149
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,908
Falin, I'd love to be friends with you.

150
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,162
{\an8}The most brilliant female student
in the school's history?

151
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,580
{\an8}That's gotta be false.

152
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,207
It's true!

153
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,584
Back in school,
I was a top-notch student, you know!

154
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,840
Anyway, this dungeon
is a mind-boggling place.

155
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,843
It's calculated to a tee,

156
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,887
and continuously circulates
enormous amounts of magic.

157
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,141
If this lunatic magician really exists,

158
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,852
he's definitely far from being sane.

159
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,856
Senshi, it would be best for you
to find another place to live.

160
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,983
That's none of your concern.

161
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,735
In the first place, you hate magic,

162
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,738
but this dungeon itself
is constructed from magic!

163
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,241
I can't hear you.

164
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,702
I see.

165
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,996
So she was talking about you.

166
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,917
When my sister
had just enrolled in magic school,

167
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,753
her letters to me were full of worry.

168
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>But ever since
she told me that she had made a friend,</i>

169
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,051
<i>it seemed like she was enjoying every day.</i>

170
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,264
She said you were an amazing person.

171
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,766
She was always complimenting you.

172
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,816
She complimented you, too.

173
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,526
She said she respected you.

174
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
Did she, now?

175
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,115
What's he good at?

176
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,993
He's really good at imitating a dog.

177
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,123
<i>Oh, well, I guess
this isn't the time to be whining.</i>

178
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,166
All right.

179
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,127
Let's go and rescue Falin
as soon as we can!

180
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,464
Come on!

181
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,008
If you're awake, get up already!

182
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,386
Here's where we are now.

183
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,641
{\an8}And this is the place the orcs mentioned
where the Red Dragon was spotted.

184
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,476
{\an8}It should take us
about two days to get there.

185
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,354
The dragon probably
won't stay in one place,

186
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,398
but it's not the sort of monster
that roams around, either.

187
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,109
Ideally, we'll set up camp
only two times more.

188
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,487
Once at the halfway point

189
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,906
and then again just before
we reach the Red Dragon.

190
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,243
We'll kick Laios out of bed
when the candle burns out.

191
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,078
Make sure to be ready.

192
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,413
Our next break
is going to be a little way off.

193
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,084
I want to wipe myself down.

194
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,711
Where?

195
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,338
I'll do it in the corner of the room.

196
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,341
Be quick about it.

197
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,847
We'll be waiting outside.

198
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,975
You can stay here.

199
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,601
I can do it clothed, you know.

200
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,437
If you say so.

201
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,942
<i>I'm bothering them, aren't I?</i>

202
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,280
<i>Maybe I should've studied illusion magic.</i>

203
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,615
<i>But that's not the issue, is it?</i>

204
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,743
<i>It was easier when half of us were girls.</i>

205
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,454
<i>This is where we part.</i>

206
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,916
What? Do you really have to leave now?

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,169
We still don't know
what happened to Falin.

208
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,466
Sorry, but we have to make a living, too.

209
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,596
<i>Just thinking about it is making me upset.</i>

210
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,681
<i>And I thought they were our friends!</i>

211
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,104
Get up, Laios!

212
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,772
Hey, wake up!

213
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,232
It's time to go!

214
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,193
There.

215
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,488
Oops. I boiled too much water.

216
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,767
U...

217
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,560
Undine!

218
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,316
What is it?

219
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,111
My staff!

220
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,245
My Water-Walk...

221
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,122
The water is moving.

222
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,959
You can't use weapons! We need fire.

223
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,876
Fire?

224
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,088
I could start a fire.

225
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,882
Marcille, do something on your own!

226
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,051
Easier said than done.

227
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,637
I hope I can hit it.

228
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,451
Marcille, don't just stand there!

229
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,787
Stay away from the water!

230
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,206
Your Water-Walk effects have worn off!

231
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,673
Marcille!

232
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,675
This is bad! Keep moving!

233
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,936
<i>I can't get away from it with this leg.</i>

234
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,112
<i>Where is it hiding?</i>

235
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,917
She's moving so slowly.
I can't bear to watch!

236
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,711
Just give me a moment to start a fire!

237
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,963
<i>It won't be ready in time...</i>

238
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,760
<i>I'm running low on magic.</i>

239
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,554
<i>I have to make my next attack count.</i>

240
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,102
<i>Where is it?</i>

241
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,104
<i>Where is it?</i>

242
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,982
<i>There must be some sort of sign.</i>

243
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,610
<i>There!</i>

244
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,154
<i>It's colored with blood.</i>

245
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,323
{\an8}It's so fast.

246
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,165
Marcille!

247
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,059
Hey.

248
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,561
It's...

249
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,399
There's only one thing to do.

250
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,822
Run!

251
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,538
Marcille, how are you doing?

252
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,543
I stopped the bleeding,
but I'm low on blood and magic.

253
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,419
I can't make a full recovery.

254
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,463
{\an8}Sorry.

255
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,422
{\an8}Don't be.

256
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,133
Rest for a bit.

257
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,176
Yeah.

258
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,430
I should've paid more attention
to Falin's healing magic lessons.

259
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,933
Hey, Laios.

260
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,478
What do we do now?

261
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,149
We can't continue on
with a mage out of magic.

262
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,861
And we can't move forward
without Water-Walk either.

263
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,196
Let's wait
for other adventurers to come by.

264
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,199
One of them might be a healer or a mage.

265
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:24,246
You really think a helpful adventurer
will just happen to show up?

266
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,582
We don't even have anything
to offer in return anyway.

267
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,877
The only thing we have is Kelpie meat.

268
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,087
Better hope our adventurer
is starving, then.

269
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,299
This source of nutrition
is a precious rarity in this dungeon.

270
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,010
That's beside the point!

271
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,596
Meat.

272
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,640
Do you have its liver as well?

273
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,975
Of course.

274
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,103
After all, the liver is rich in iron.

275
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,649
{\an8}Iron...

276
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,984
{\an8}This means...

277
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,446
-A barbecue!
-A barbecue!

278
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,497
Mane, neck, liver,

279
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:12,502
ribs, tail, round, loin,

280
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,129
and vegetables.

281
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,133
KELPIE GRILLED MEAT

282
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:19,885
Marcille.

283
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,762
Marcille.

284
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,140
Can you sit up?

285
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,893
We prepared something nice for you.

286
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,285
Round meat.

287
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,287
What about the liver?

288
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,666
The guts should be cooked thoroughly.

289
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,047
{\an8}Sorry, Marcille. I'll be eating first.

290
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,052
It's not so gamey.

291
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,055
Yeah, it's a bit stringy, but it's good.

292
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,767
Does it taste more like a horse
or a marine animal?

293
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,562
It's too bad I haven't had the chance
to try either, so I can't say.

294
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,189
Rib meat.

295
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,817
The fat tastes sweet.

296
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,402
It's so soft.

297
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,071
Marcille, the liver is done.

298
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,739
Tenderloin meat.

299
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,993
It melts in your mouth.

300
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,327
I love this.

301
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,579
More liver for you, Marcille.

302
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,373
Tail meat.

303
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,083
It's good.

304
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,669
It tastes pretty interesting.

305
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,212
Have more, Marcille.

306
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,965
More liver, Marcille.

307
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,591
Is it good, Marcille?

308
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,218
Eat up, Marcille.

309
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,262
How do you like it, Marcille?

310
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,188
Let me eat the other parts, too!

311
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,321
Looks like she's regained some energy.

312
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,989
Liver sure is potent.

313
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,492
But what are we going to do
about her magic shortage?

314
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,495
If only there was a meat
that could replenish magic.

315
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,248
Why did you stuff magic grass
in a Basilisk?

316
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,751
I believe it was the best choice.

317
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,883
Is it just me,
or do you also smell something?

318
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,885
It's coming from below.

319
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,553
What is that smell?

320
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,431
Is it the scent of grilling meat?

321
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,516
Someone must be cooking.

322
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,686
What, seriously?

323
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,772
What kind of fool

324
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,192
cooks meat in a place like this?

325
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,908
