1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,068
Izutsumi, Chilchuck...

3
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,946
Could you slow down a bit?

4
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,657
{\an8}Cracks are all over the floor,
and it's hard to walk.

5
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,409
I didn't notice.

6
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,829
Let's take a break.

7
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,082
{\an8}What is this? An old folks' stroll?

8
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,794
Something's bothering me.

9
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,837
In our current forms,

10
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,298
{\an8}how different are our actual ages
from how old we look?

11
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,009
Laios, how old are you now?

12
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,761
I'm 26.

13
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,348
Senshi, how old
does Laios look to you now?

14
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,351
Around 60, maybe?

15
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:27,147
<i>They say a dwarf lives
2,5 times longer than a tall-man.</i>

16
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,315
<i>So 26 years for a tall-man...</i>

17
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,943
<i>is like 65 for a dwarf.</i>

18
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,114
<i>So, our appearance
reflects our actual age.</i>

19
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,075
What really concerns me
is our remaining lifespan.

20
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,370
Do we age at the same pace
as before our transformation,

21
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,873
or do we age according to our new forms?

22
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,335
Marcille, you act like
this is none of your concern.

23
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,795
But if the latter is true,

24
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,132
the average lifespan
for us half-foots is 50!

25
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:58,219
{\an8}In less than 40 years,
you'll be all wrinkled and die!

26
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,429
{\an8}What?!

27
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,265
WRINKLECILLE

28
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,642
Is the lifespan really that short?

29
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,728
I thought you could live until 100.

30
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,396
Some do, but...

31
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,772
It's only a small percentage.

32
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,280
I was just joking.

33
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:22,076
My point is, if that's true,
these mushrooms are too convenient.

34
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,080
There are loads of people who would pay
a fortune to change their race,

35
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,791
but I've never seen those mushrooms
for sale anywhere.

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,377
<i>In other words, this transformation
must be temporary,</i>

37
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,129
<i>or it comes with nasty side effects.</i>

38
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,173
Side effects, huh?

39
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,050
That's a possibility.

40
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,552
I was hoping
we could make use of it somehow,

41
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,471
but I guess it's not that simple.

42
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,972
Make use of it how?

43
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,974
Do you want to become
a demi-human or something?

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,559
T-That's not it.

45
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,812
I was thinking about Falin.

46
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,147
Falin?

47
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,358
This is just a what-if, but...

48
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,569
Say everything works out, and we manage
to defeat the lunatic magician.

49
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,947
I repent.

50
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,323
<i>Falin regains herself.</i>

51
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,409
What have I been doing?

52
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,577
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

53
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,246
<i>We return to the surface.</i>

54
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,206
Honestly, we had such a rough time!

55
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>People will be terrified.</i>

56
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,585
{\an8}Right?

57
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,089
I think it'll be tough for her
to remain a dragon from the waist down.

58
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,340
-You stupid...
-Hold on!

59
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,800
Let's hear him out.

60
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,303
<i>I've thought of hiding the lower part
of her body inside a hole.</i>

61
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,346
Welcome!

62
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>However,</i>

63
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,977
{\an8}a large monster can't survive
in a village with little mana.

64
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,438
Just like a fish can't survive
outside of water,

65
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,358
Falin might not be able
to survive in a village.

66
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,485
And that's where

67
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,655
those Changeling mushrooms come into play.

68
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,743
<i>If we can somehow change
her lower body to a smaller dragon,</i>

69
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,080
Falin might be able to live comfortably
in a human village!

70
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,292
-What...
-What an optimistic guy!

71
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,501
Mušḫuššu!

72
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,505
{\an8}Well, I won't deny
that I also have a wish to transform.

73
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,301
Tall-men are just
so unremarkable and dull...

74
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,012
Hey, don't you hear that strange noise?

75
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,140
No. It's probably
the sound of dwarf relics.

76
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,349
It's not that.

77
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,893
It sounds like rocks
striking against each other.

78
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,522
And it seems like
it's slowly getting closer.

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,317
I know.

80
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,861
{\an8}Gargoyles!

81
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,031
Didn't you close the door properly?

82
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,907
W-We need to get out of here quickly!

83
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,160
They're getting closer!

84
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,621
If we don't do something,
they'll keep coming after us.

85
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,458
We should ambush them.

86
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,418
{\an8}B-But...

87
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,003
{\an8}I'll distract the enemies.

88
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,338
{\an8}Chilchuck, hold the pot.

89
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,173
{\an8}Izutsumi, slip around behind them.

90
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,841
{\an8}Senshi, wait for the right moment.

91
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,468
{\an8}Marcille, how close are the enemies?

92
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,552
{\an8}Like I said,

93
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,304
they're right there!

94
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,308
Laios!

95
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,644
Damn it!

96
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,772
Everyone, watch out!

97
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,073
Do you get why the first thing I do
is take cover?

98
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,866
Don't hang around our feet.

99
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,451
Easier said than done...

100
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,787
Forget it! You're still as clumsy as ever.

101
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,788
Come here!

102
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,752
What is this smoke?

103
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,004
Is it one of your magic?

104
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,590
Are you two hurt?

105
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,134
No! The sword
just passed between our arms!

106
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,094
Good.

107
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,678
Pass me Kensuke, would you?

108
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,596
Sure.

109
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,726
Did it always look like that?

110
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,769
Nope.

111
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,395
Has the shape of the sword changed?

112
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,023
Was that smoke...

113
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,151
-Spores from Changelings?
-Spores from Changelings?

114
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,780
{\an8}B-But I don't see
a ring of mushrooms anywhere.

115
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,282
It passed through a circle
we formed with our arms.

116
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,119
Does that mean...

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,544
They keep flying away!

118
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,545
Everyone!

119
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,297
Hold hands and make a ring right now!

120
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,133
Read the situation before you say that!

121
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,259
I did!

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,054
Now what?

123
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,181
What do we do?

124
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,059
We'll get a Gargoyle
to pass through our ring.

125
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,936
If my guess is correct,

126
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,605
{\an8}the Gargoyle will transform!

127
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,525
Here it comes! Dodge!

128
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,735
There's a wall on that side! This way!

129
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,778
Ow!

130
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,531
I'll tear in two!

131
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,536
Owie.

132
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,798
It's stuck!

133
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,300
Now, surround it quickly!

134
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,936
{\an8}We did it! Where's the Gargoyle?

135
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,313
{\an8}Look!

136
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,692
That's the Gargoyle?

137
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,861
It really transformed!

138
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,363
I see. The Changelings caused this.

139
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,325
So nonliving things change faster.

140
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,243
Laios!

141
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,369
Are you okay?

142
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,371
It hurts, but I'll manage.

143
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,082
Dwarves have sturdy bodies.

144
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,125
{\an8}Damn it.

145
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,922
That one won't come down.

146
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,633
How can we get it
to pass through our arms?

147
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,305
-Marcille.
-Huh?

148
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,806
-Give me your hand for a bit.
-Huh?

149
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,978
-It should work.
-Um.

150
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,438
-Let's do it.
-All right!

151
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,107
We're going to get up close to it,

152
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,276
and provoke it into attacking us!

153
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,570
-Hey, what do I...
-Run in sync with the call!

154
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,947
Here we go!

155
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,201
-One, two...
-One, two...

156
00:08:55,284 --> 00:09:01,082
-One, two...
-One, two...

157
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,253
Here it comes! Are you ready?

158
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,837
Ready for what?!

159
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,673
-Ready, set...
-Ready, set...

160
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,591
Fly, Marcille!

161
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,816
It's over.

162
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,944
There was nothing to it.

163
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:34,365
All we had to do was wash the spores
off our bodies to turn back.

164
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,742
It feels wrong.

165
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,786
Don't worry about it. It's just water.

166
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,871
You should wash them off thoroughly.

167
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,624
Right now, we're like
seedbeds for mushrooms.

168
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,671
<i>Now I understand why those mushrooms
have this characteristic.</i>

169
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,092
<i>When animals have their forms
changed by Changelings...</i>

170
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,427
-Run!
-Run!

171
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,012
<i>They're hated by their own kind.</i>

172
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,680
<i>They die.</i>

173
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,266
<i>And they become new Changelings.</i>

174
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,184
It's quite the side effect.

175
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,606
Unlike Gargoyles,
it'll take time for us to turn back.

176
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,983
Let's prepare a meal as we wait.

177
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,444
Of course.

178
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>Kensuke,look at how you've changed.</i>

179
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:23,623
<i>I doubt it was the mushrooms
that turned the insides into a key, but...</i>

180
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,417
<i>Will it revert if I give it a wash?</i>

181
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,671
What are we having today?

182
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,091
We still have some dumplings left,
so we'll boil them.

183
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,426
That again.

184
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,470
Do you have a problem?

185
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,555
Not really. I'm just tired of them.

186
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,309
-<i>Tired of them?</i>
-She sure is a free spirit.

187
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,646
<i>I'll try cooking them differently.</i>

188
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,360
<i>Heat oil in a pan,
and gently place the dumplings in it.</i>

189
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,320
H-Hot!

190
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,908
<i>When the wrappers are golden brown,
take them out and let the oil drain.</i>

191
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,994
{\an8}<i>Izutsumi is a light eater</i>

192
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,413
{\an8}<i>and never touches something
she doesn't like.</i>

193
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,751
<i>To make sure she eats enough,
I have to put in the time and effort.</i>

194
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,423
What do you think, Izutsumi?

195
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,425
You just fried them?

196
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,135
Stop that!

197
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,183
<i>Just maybe...</i>

198
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,316
It changed its shape!

199
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,986
Just as I thought,
it seems like the mouth acts as a ring.

200
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,989
And there are so many
varieties of dumplings.

201
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,701
What if I eat one and end up
growing mushrooms in my stomach?

202
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:47,081
We had the Hippogriff's meat,
and that didn't happen.

203
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,707
Digestion is quite powerful.

204
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,794
Now, help set the dishes.

205
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,796
It's done!

206
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,465
DUMPLINGS TRANSFORMED
BY A CHANGELING FAIRY RING

207
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,342
There are so many types.

208
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,933
This one has Barometz meat in it.

209
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,643
Mutton, huh?

210
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,728
So the filling changes too.

211
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,440
This one's got cheese inside!

212
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,233
This one's sweet.

213
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>What meat is this?</i>

214
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,829
Your legs are just too long!

215
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,584
{\an8}My body's back to normal!

216
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,626
{\an8}Damn it.

217
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,378
{\an8}What an awful way to wake up.

218
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,172
Thank goodness.

219
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,007
I'm so glad.

220
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,051
Well then, we should get going soon.

221
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,263
You should change into something lighter.

222
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,348
This floor is warm.

223
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,644
The temperature is conducive
to creature reproduction.

224
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:55,357
But I'm not sure if there are any living
things ahead in this environment.

225
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,278
I should have made sausages or something.

226
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,865
Speaking of which,
didn't you make some with Red Dragon meat?

227
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:04,909
<i>I did.</i>

228
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,076
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

229
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,204
But I lost them.

230
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,580
Is that so?

231
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,831
Never mind.

232
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,459
I don't like it when it's hot.

233
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,713
Why is your sword wrapped in a cloth?

234
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,882
{\an8}Huh? That's because...

235
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,175
{\an8}Show me.

236
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,135
{\an8}No, I can't do that.

237
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,345
{\an8}Show me!

238
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,973
What should we do with him?

239
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,018
Should we form a ring around him
and beat him up?

240
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,812
Go wash it off right now.

241
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,733
How are things over there?

242
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,110
All I see is a strange building.

243
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,904
I don't see any other paths.

244
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,617
A strange building?

245
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,165
It's probably an automatic trolley.

246
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,042
Let's take a peek inside.

247
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,923
I bet it won't move anymore.

248
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,552
If you dismantle it and sell it,
you can fetch a pretty good price.

249
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,431
It moved!

250
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,684
Senshi, what did you do?

251
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,977
Nothing.

252
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,230
Maybe it's the type that moves
when someone boards it.

253
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,066
There's a description here,
so I'll read it.

254
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,943
Take a seat.

255
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,503
There isn't much written here.

256
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,840
It doesn't feel dangerous so far,

257
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,217
so let's ride it as far as it goes.

258
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,598
Maybe I'll brew some tea.

259
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,475
What's that?

260
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,353
Roasted Dryad seeds.

261
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,188
Is the magic circle ready?

262
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,273
I think so.

263
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,610
I can't say for sure if it's working.

264
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,948
{\an8}It's slow, but it seems to be heating up.

265
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,992
By the way, Laios,

266
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,787
why did you and your sister
become adventurers?

267
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,581
{\an8}Huh? Me?

268
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,834
{\an8}You don't strike me as someone
who dreams of making a fortune.

269
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,463
{\an8}It's a long story, but...

270
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,509
{\an8}<i>When I was in my teens,
I got fed up with my village.</i>

271
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,262
<i>And I went to a school in the town
and joined the army.</i>

272
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,266
{\an8}<i>But in the end,
I didn't fit in there either.</i>

273
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,436
<i>And I got picked up by a caravan
that passed through the town.</i>

274
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,146
<i>So he's a deserter?</i>

275
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,317
<i>I slowly drifted south,
taking odd jobs along the way.</i>

276
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,364
<i>Falin was boarding
at a nearby magic school,</i>

277
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,532
<i>so I dropped by to see her.</i>

278
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,868
<i>But she insisted on joining me.</i>

279
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,999
<i>And together, we reached this island.</i>

280
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>When we first arrived on this island,
gold-peeling was thriving.</i>

281
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,798
<i>And there was plenty of escorting work.</i>

282
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,511
<i>Then, we just stayed
and hung around the dungeon.</i>

283
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,065
That's how I ended up here.

284
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,444
What a complete lack of foresight.

285
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,073
You're one thing, but why did you
let your sister go with you?

286
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,867
She could've had a better life at school.

287
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,415
<i>Falin's childhood wasn't very fortunate.</i>

288
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,209
<i>She had a talent for magic,
which she was shunned for.</i>

289
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,338
<i>I couldn't stand the environment.</i>

290
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,757
<i>So I left the village
a year before she did.</i>

291
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,011
<i>Until she entered the magic school, no,</i>

292
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,346
<i>until she met Marcille,</i>

293
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,473
<i>she had her meals all alone.</i>

294
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,686
It breaks my heart to think about it.

295
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,191
Well, Falin's spirit
was much stronger than mine,

296
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,986
so maybe it didn't bother her too much.

297
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,866
But that's why I made a promise to myself
to never abandon her again.

298
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,828
At least, not until someone else shows up
whom she wants to be with.

299
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,005
What the heck? Gross!

300
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,174
Falin...

301
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,594
used to bring me a lot of things.

302
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,097
<i>Strange nuts.</i>

303
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,058
<i>And odd plants.</i>

304
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,686
<i>I've always wondered
why she kept bringing them to me, but...</i>

305
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,023
She probably wanted
to eat them with you, Marcille.

306
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,919
{\an8}I can't wait...

307
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,713
{\an8}to share meals with her again.

308
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,633
You'll be able to soon.

309
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,928
The way I see it,

310
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,764
Falin is like bacon and eggs right now.

311
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,935
We once compared souls to eggs.

312
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,729
<i>A sunny side up rests on top
of strips of bacon.</i>

313
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,942
<i>They're stuck together, but it looks like
we can peel them apart nicely.</i>

314
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,735
<i>That's Falin.</i>

315
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,363
Compared to that,
Izutsumi is more like an omelet

316
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,948
with ingredients mixed inside.

317
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:40,202
<i>With effort, you might be able
to remove the ingredients,</i>

318
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,914
<i>but it's easy to imagine
the egg getting broken up.</i>

319
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,625
So, in Izutsumi's case,

320
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:51,213
we'll have to find a more careful
and complicated approach.

321
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,465
In other words,

322
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,468
<i>if we cut off the dragon waist down,</i>

323
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,971
<i>can we turn Falin back
into her human form?</i>

324
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,974
It's not that simple, is it?

325
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,600
That day,

326
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,937
I preserved some of the Dragon meat,

327
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,192
but it all turned back into flesh
and merged with Falin.

328
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,697
<i>On the other hand, some of the meat
didn't turn back into a dragon.</i>

329
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,367
It's the parts that we ate at dinner.

330
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,831
Meat that has been digested
by other creatures loses its identity.

331
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,501
{\an8}This is the only clear law in this dungeon

332
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,671
{\an8}where the line
between life and death is blurred.

333
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,467
In that case,
if we consume all the dragon parts,

334
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:42,014
we may be able to drive out
the soul of the dragon.

335
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,060
Y-You know,

336
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,771
I'm surprised
to hear that from you, Senshi.

337
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,983
I thought you were against
that sort of thing.

338
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,278
I'm still against resurrecting people.

339
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,907
However, Falin is alive now.

340
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,786
And you just want to release her
from the dungeon.

341
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,040
I'll gladly help you with that.

342
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,793
Eat the dragon parts.

343
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,130
B-But...

344
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,842
how many meals would that make?

345
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,552
-That's your problem?
-That's your problem?

346
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,970
What else would it be?

347
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,598
It's the most promising method
we've got so far!

348
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,600
Do you have a better idea?

349
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,270
{\an8}Consuming a creature you've killed
to make it your own.

350
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,606
{\an8}Why didn't I realize it sooner?

351
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,359
{\an8}It's what we've been doing all along!

352
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,779
But it's massive.

353
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,241
<i>Even if the five of us push
to consume a kilogram each day,</i>

354
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,368
<i>it'll still take us
over a decade to finish it all.</i>

355
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,788
Do you honestly think
I can handle eating a kilogram?

356
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,625
And considering Falin's condition,
we definitely don't have time for that.

357
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,379
So, just ask others to help.

358
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,216
It's time to make full use
of the connections you've built.

359
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,885
You're banking on my connections for this?

360
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,263
It's not like you're without any.

361
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,223
Can't you think of anyone?

362
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,393
<i>The orcs.</i>

363
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,145
<i>They'll likely eat a fair amount
and seem like a promising choice.</i>

364
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,314
<i>The inhabitants of the Golden Castle.</i>

365
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,025
<i>They might not have
the heartiest appetite,</i>

366
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,653
<i>but their numbers and livestock
can compensate for that.</i>

367
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,364
<i>Then there's Namari, Shuro,
and their groups.</i>

368
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,908
<i>Those two will lend a hand
if we appeal to their emotions.</i>

369
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,287
<i>And Kabru seemed interested
in trying monster food.</i>

370
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,915
That's all I can come up with
at the moment.

371
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,042
That's quite a list.

372
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,169
But we're hardly enough
to consume the entire dragon.

373
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,964
I wish we could also have another troop.

374
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,340
But at least

375
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,343
we've got clear goals now.

376
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,182
<i>First, we release the Winged Lion
from the heart of the dungeon.</i>

377
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,183
<i>Second,</i>

378
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,187
<i>with the Lion's aid, we neutralize
the lunatic magician's power.</i>

379
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,188
<i>Third,</i>

380
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,526
<i>we recruit people to assist us
in consuming Falin's dragon parts.</i>

381
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,362
I'm suddenly
feeling optimistic about this.

382
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,324
It's going to be one extravagant feast.

383
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,076
There are no troops inside the dungeon.

384
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,747
What's this sickening feeling?

385
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,958
The air in the dungeon is stale.

386
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,628
While you guys were inside,
it underwent another big transformation.

387
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,047
A transformation?

388
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,673
You'll get it once you see it.

389
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,469
Well, it's going to be
an unpleasant transformation

390
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,637
for the folks behind us, at least.

391
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,733
Don't eat stuff like that!

392
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,862
What's all this racket?

393
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,240
{\an8}<i>Walking Mushrooms.</i>

394
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,452
{\an8}How about using them
as a garnish for a steak

395
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,370
{\an8}made from Falin's dragon parts?

396
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,998
{\an8}Or should we make a stew instead?

397
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,125
{\an8}-The broth from the bones...
-Stop it!

398
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,087
{\an8}Now's not the time
to be planning Falin menus!

399
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,130
I'm hungry.

400
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,008
Shall we prepare something?

401
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,384
I second that!

402
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,386
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

403
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,847
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

404
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,266
<i>There is no hierarchy.</i>

405
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,145
<i>Eating is a privilege for those who live.</i>

406
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,815
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

407
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,484
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

408
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,870
