1
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,645
How boring is this?

3
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,938
You got that right.

4
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,523
Take this, will you?

5
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,405
It's good!

6
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,907
It's good.

7
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,617
When we enter the dungeon again,

8
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,912
we won't be able
to have delicious food for a while.

9
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,747
Better savor it well, then.

10
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,750
Hey, Kabru!

11
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,503
How're you doing lately?

12
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,672
Seems like you're doing well.

13
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,591
Nah, we still have a long way to go.

14
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,094
Until just a while ago,
you were just fledglings.

15
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,012
But now you have an air of confidence.

16
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,849
On the other hand,
none of the other big parties...

17
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,685
are faring so well.

18
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,436
Is that so?

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,439
Missing persons. Falling outs.

20
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,192
Oh, and trouble over money matters.

21
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,278
To everyone's surprise,
it might be folks like you

22
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,364
who end up defeating the lunatic magician.

23
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,199
Oh, no.

24
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,701
I'm not sure about that.

25
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,703
So you say, but you just might!

26
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,959
-You gave him a polite smile.
-Huh?

27
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,420
Instead of putting on a polite smile
and being noncommittal,

28
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,380
you should have told him clearly.

29
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,466
"Of course, we'll be the ones
to defeat the magician."

30
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,846
"We won't become adventurers like you
who live from hand-to-mouth."

31
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,931
Rin...

32
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,146
Let's show them with action
rather than words.

33
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,651
So, we'll venture
a little deeper this time.

34
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,486
Let's make careful preparations.

35
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,998
Welcome.

36
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:31,210
A week's worth of food for six people
and water for two days.

37
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,463
Here you go.

38
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:41,429
Food is a trickier issue than monsters
when venturing into the lower levels.

39
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,848
Just a week's worth of food is this heavy.

40
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,393
I wonder how people manage
when they go underground for a month.

41
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,770
Mickbell,

42
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,773
let me tell you how.

43
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,738
They eat other adventurers
they meet in the dungeon!

44
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,037
{\an8}It's probably easier to hunt monsters
than attack humans.

45
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,915
I sure don't want to end up like them.

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,470
I've never been to this floor before,
but it's not that hard.

47
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,722
At this rate,
we could probably go even deeper.

48
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,934
You have a point, Rin,
but let's be careful.

49
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,812
You never know what might happen here.

50
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,190
I've heard that things have been strange
inside the dungeon recently.

51
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,193
Monsters are more active than usual,

52
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,821
and the dungeon's layout is shifting.

53
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,157
Something unusual is happening,
that's for sure.

54
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,076
Let's keep our guard up.

55
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,202
Hey!

56
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,205
Kabru, look what I found!

57
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,957
Open it.

58
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,084
It's just going to be
a waste of time again.

59
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,421
You never know. There might be
a stack of gold coins inside.

60
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,841
Like we ever discovered
anything valuable in those.

61
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,678
It's something a zombie was carrying
as if it were a treasure,

62
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,054
quite literally.

63
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,473
It wouldn't hurt to take a peek inside.

64
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,975
Huh?

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,476
What is it?

66
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,022
Whoa! Look at all that gold,
silver, and gems!

67
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,607
-Wow!
-Awesome!

68
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,984
Can I have some?

69
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,861
Money, so much.

70
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,658
I thought all the treasure in this place
had already been looted.

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,579
Maybe this is one of the strange things
happening inside the dungeon.

72
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,712
In any case, it's a big help.

73
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,381
Venturing into the lower levels
is quite expensive, after all.

74
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:46,095
All right. Let's call it a day for now
and return to town!

75
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,388
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

76
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,775
Looks like a party got wiped out here.

77
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,528
Oh dear. Seems like they were
on their way back to town.

78
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,072
The poor things.

79
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,990
I don't see any visible injuries.

80
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,201
Maybe they were attacked
by a type of ghost.

81
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,369
Maybe they starved.

82
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,331
No, I think they had a quarrel over money.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,212
The corpse retriever
will probably find them soon,

84
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,964
but I'll pray for them
so they don't become zombies.

85
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,759
I can't do it the way Falin does, though.

86
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,183
What should we do
with their scattered stuff?

87
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,227
Let's gather them in one spot.

88
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,231
I bet they'll end up
in the corpse retriever's pockets, though.

89
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,777
Huh? What was that for?

90
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,112
I-It's nothing.

91
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,115
<i>My sword suddenly jumped.</i>

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,869
<i>What's going on? It was calm until now.</i>

93
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,372
<i>Hey, don't wrap around my fingers!</i>

94
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,751
<i>"Draw me!"</i>

95
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,046
<i>It feels like that's what it's saying!</i>

96
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,517
Marcille! Get away from the bodies!

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,768
Huh?

98
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,752
Stunning magic, huh?

99
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,839
Thank goodness it wasn't an explosion.

100
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,756
Ow!

101
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,049
Ugh, what the heck?!

102
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,802
They're all Treasure Bugs! Gross!

103
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,264
I see.

104
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,933
So they were all wiped out
by Treasure Bugs.

105
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,145
I haven't seen them around lately,
so I didn't realize.

106
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,397
What? You did realize, though.

107
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,900
Yeah! How did you know?

108
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,151
Um...

109
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,653
I thought... it moved.

110
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,071
<i>My sword, I mean.</i>

111
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,866
<i>It's already calm again.</i>

112
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,660
<i>It probably responded
to the Treasure Bug, right?</i>

113
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,455
If that's the case...

114
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,291
{\an8}He's becoming less and less human.

115
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,344
There.

116
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,596
{\an8}No!

117
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,974
He's really sorting them out.

118
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,186
These are edible.

119
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,479
And these aren't.

120
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,898
Do they taste good, though?

121
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,274
Of course.

122
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,986
Bugs are an excellent source of nutrition.

123
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,738
They have a delicious taste
and flavor, too.

124
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,741
And they look good as well.

125
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,618
Don't show its underside to us.

126
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,913
How can you tell
whether they're edible or not?

127
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,248
It depends.

128
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,625
This one is easy to tell.

129
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,379
The necklace has legs growing
between its segments.

130
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,132
With brooches and coins,
you look at their underside.

131
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,136
It's interesting how Coin Bugs
have different designs based on their sex.

132
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,682
Rings have a springy shank.

133
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,519
With tiaras, dunk them in water,
and you can tell them apart easily.

134
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,896
If they float, they're Treasure Bugs.

135
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,147
They're light, after all.

136
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,318
Anyway, let's cook them
while they're still senseless.

137
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,029
To improve their texture,

138
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,032
remove the legs from the pearl centipedes.

139
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,535
Then, skewer and grill them.

140
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:42,456
Heat some oil and cook the underside
of the Coin Bugs.

141
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,042
Salt them lightly,

142
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,087
and coat them with oil as you stir them.

143
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,547
There!

144
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,175
{\an8}It looks nice if you flip them
with their backs facing up.

145
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,679
For the tiara, remove the eggs and larvae,

146
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,182
shatter the nest, and stew together.

147
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,061
Put them in a jar...

148
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,355
And it's done!

149
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,066
NATURAL AND TASTY TREASURE BUG SNACKS

150
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,821
{\an8}It looks nice, but it doesn't really
whet my appetite in more ways than one.

151
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,783
That said, I have eaten a Coin Bug before.

152
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,453
There are local cuisines like this.

153
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,831
It looks lucky,
and it's supposed to bring good fortune.

154
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,794
{\an8}It's way better
than the one I had a long time ago!

155
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,588
Of course, it is.

156
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,343
Monsters inside the dungeon
generally taste better than those outside.

157
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,972
If you keep them outside,
their flavor quickly deteriorates.

158
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,817
It's gooey.

159
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,862
I can't wear necklaces anymore.

160
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,864
They're like small fish and pretty tasty.

161
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,701
The same monster will taste better
when they're from the lower levels.

162
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,911
I can't wait to try it.

163
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,371
Thank you.

164
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,377
<i>It's sweet and delicious.</i>

165
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,338
<i>They really look just like gems.</i>

166
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,258
<i>In the context of concealing itself
from enemies through camouflage,</i>

167
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,302
<i>it's one of your kind.</i>

168
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,221
<i>Is that why you responded?</i>

169
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,264
<i>Wait...</i>

170
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,184
Give me one.

171
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
Nothing.

172
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,579
<i>That was intimidation.</i>

173
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,917
<i>Did it try to defeat the bug with me
because it thinks I'm a friend?</i>

174
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,670
<i>You cute thing!</i>

175
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,255
<i>Let me give you a name.</i>

176
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,634
Let's get going soon.

177
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,512
Can I throw away the inedible ones?

178
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,805
If you want.

179
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,809
What happens if you eat the inedible ones?

180
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,311
Do they taste bad? Or are they poisonous?

181
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,564
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,818
You can't possibly eat real gems.

183
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,697
<i>You can't possibly eat real gems.</i>

184
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>Real gems...</i>

185
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,659
<i>Gems...</i>

186
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,912
{\an8}-You should have said that first!
-You should have said that first!

187
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,043
I know! Your name is Kensuke!

188
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,516
You're still munching on that?

189
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,393
It's heartier than it looks.

190
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,729
Seriously, you're making it hard
to keep my guard up.

191
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,695
It suddenly got cold.

192
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,782
That white hazy thing...

193
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,744
That's a lot of ghosts.

194
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,746
Let's go.
It wouldn't do for us to be spotted.

195
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,123
Ghosts?

196
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,709
They must've gathered,
attracted by the corpses.

197
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,880
{\an8}Can't you simply use magic to...

198
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,426
{\an8}Right. Falin isn't with us.

199
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,345
{\an8}I miss her, too.

200
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,015
It was the least I could do,
but I prayed for them.

201
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,643
So I don't think
the ghosts will possess the bodies there...

202
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,942
There's one behind us.

203
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,401
Run!

204
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,378
Stupid!

205
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,888
My ears...

206
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,890
Hurry! Before another one comes!

207
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,646
Looks like that noise
attracted their attention even more.

208
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,026
Don't you know other magic
besides something so flashy?

209
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,154
Something random like the stuff
Falin used would have done.

210
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:29,201
{\an8}Random? Don't you know
how advanced her magic was?

211
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,789
Falin, Laios' sister,

212
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,042
was good at dealing with ghosts.

213
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,337
<i>Lifgant Ardinbam.</i>

214
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,884
There! That should do it.

215
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,386
Ghosts can't harm you anymore.

216
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,516
Isn't it easier to blow up ghosts
when they show up?

217
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,644
It should be easy with your magic, Falin.

218
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,524
I'd rather not do stuff like that.

219
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:05,988
A dispersed ghost will simply return
to its normal state over time.

220
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,157
It causes them unnecessary suffering.

221
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,867
How sweet of you.

222
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,411
I admire your principles, but...

223
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,082
Those who steal another person's body...

224
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,878
deserve some punishment, don't you think?

225
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,429
He's one of the missing adventurers.

226
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,974
All right. Give me a moment.

227
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,018
I'll neutralize him and...

228
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,230
Let me handle it.
There's no need to harm it.

229
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,817
Wait, Falin! Don't do anything reckless!

230
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,832
I'm sorry. Please return him.

231
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,547
Falin!

232
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,098
Seems like she was an important person.

233
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,726
Yeah. Falin was really amazing.

234
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,855
If the ghosts catch up with us,

235
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,359
I'll have to do something with my magic.

236
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,318
Forget it!

237
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,530
Are you planning to explode
all those ghosts individually?

238
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,744
So, I should do what Falin did, right?

239
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,789
Make them explode with a gentle embrace.

240
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,791
Make them explode with a gentle embrace.

241
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,127
-Make them explode with...
-No way! You couldn't possibly!

242
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,839
You said yourself you can't do it
the way Falin does it!

243
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,757
Falin wouldn't say that, though!

244
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,510
Anyway, what if you run out of magic?

245
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,014
That's why I'm trying to make them explode
with the minimal amount of magic needed!

246
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,182
And I'm saying you can't do that!

247
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,517
Hey, both of you...

248
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,980
Turns out it's not that easy
to run from the dead.

249
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,274
Right.

250
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,027
They'll catch us if we bicker
in a place like this.

251
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,280
Wait, what are you doing?

252
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,658
I'll prepare a charm
to drive away the ghosts.

253
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,535
A charm?

254
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,619
Holy water.

255
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,455
You had that on you?

256
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,665
No. I'm going to make it now.

257
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,709
{\an8}Make it?

258
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,669
{\an8}Are you a priest or something?

259
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:31,425
<i>There are many customs around the world
to ward off different demons.</i>

260
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,968
<i>For example, lighting a fire.</i>

261
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,473
<i>Fire drives away the darkness
and has the power to create and take.</i>

262
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,932
<i>Everywhere and throughout the ages,</i>

263
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,519
<i>fire has been used
to ward off demons and as something holy.</i>

264
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,938
That's true,

265
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,149
but will the light of a candle
ward off ghosts?

266
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,985
While each may be weak on their own,

267
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,030
together in large numbers,
they can become a substantial force.

268
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,450
<i>Another example is the golden beetle.</i>

269
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,453
<i>Its characteristics led to it
being worshipped</i>

270
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,872
as a symbol of the sun and its deity.

271
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,666
<i>Another example is alcohol.</i>

272
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,713
It's an essential offering to a god
and possesses disinfective properties.

273
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,840
<i>Another example is salt.</i>

274
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,470
There are customs that use it
to drive away evil and cleanse oneself.

275
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,390
Sugar is similar to that,
so I'll add some just in case.

276
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,976
It's probably less effective,
so I'll add a lot.

277
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,853
You're totally winging this!

278
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,980
Aside from that, there are herbs

279
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,274
and the internal organs of creatures.

280
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,319
Add the power of fire to this and...

281
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,324
We have holy water!

282
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,867
SPECIAL FUSION HOLY WATER

283
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,037
Here they come!

284
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,207
Tightly seal the jar of holy water and...

285
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,125
Seal?!

286
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,668
Aren't you going to use it?

287
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,669
Be patient.

288
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,254
Then, tie it with string...

289
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,883
At this rate...

290
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,810
<i>Oh no...</i>

291
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,646
<i>Falin.</i>

292
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,945
<i>That day, if only she didn't shield me...</i>

293
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,657
<i>If I were the one devoured
by the dragon instead,</i>

294
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,202
<i>this sorry mess would never have happened.</i>

295
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,746
<i>Forgive me.</i>

296
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,261
Huh?

297
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,023
For a moment just now,
I saw my dead dad beyond the river.

298
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,443
W-What on earth?

299
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,405
<i>The ghosts that come in contact
with the jar of holy water are dispersing.</i>

300
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,829
That holy water is doing the trick, huh?

301
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,331
That actually works?

302
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,711
Maybe we were being possessed...

303
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,213
by Falin.

304
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,089
How could you say that?

305
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,966
Falin would never do such a thing.

306
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,010
She isn't a ghost yet in the first place!

307
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,720
No, that's not what I meant.

308
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,390
We shouldn't say stuff like,
"Only Falin could have done this,"

309
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,352
or "Things would've been easier
if Falin was around."

310
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,104
Right now, it's just us.

311
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,108
So we have to take care
of things on our own.

312
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,988
You're right.

313
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,907
Senshi!

314
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,243
Let me help.

315
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,719
It's over.

316
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,140
I-It's completely covered in frost!

317
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:12,104
Using it like this is more effective
than scattering it, don't you think?

318
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,105
True.

319
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,398
Ghosts can pass through walls,

320
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,483
so it won't matter
if the jar is sealed or not.

321
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,486
But what is this?

322
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,785
You made ice cream.

323
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,915
EXORCISM SORBET TO DRIVE AWAY EVILS

324
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,627
Is it safe to eat something
that came in contact with so many ghosts?

325
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:40,299
And consuming such potent holy water
could cause problems as well.

326
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,177
I think I'm taking too much sugar today.

327
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,516
It's good!

328
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,483
You're right. It's good!

329
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,111
It tastes really fresh!

330
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,449
{\an8}Seems like we managed to drive away
the ghosts without making them too upset.

331
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,408
{\an8}True!

332
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,201
You added the internal organs
of a creature.

333
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,037
What creature?

334
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,289
I added some Slime shavings.

335
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,624
So that's why it jiggles a little.

336
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,918
I love how smooth the texture is.

337
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,966
This... makes me think...

338
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,680
If Falin were here, we probably
couldn't have had such tasty food.

339
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,683
{\an8}Huh?

340
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,518
Are you saying...

341
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,730
you're glad Falin ended up that way?

342
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,274
Is that what you're saying? Now?!

343
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,027
Huh? No, I was just...

344
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,155
There are things you should say
and things you shouldn't.

345
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,205
<i>If only Falin were here right about now.</i>

346
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,667
{\an8}He meant to say
every cloud has a silver lining.

347
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,462
{\an8}<i>She'd say something like that
to clarify what I meant!</i>

348
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:06,009
{\an8}Your bond with your friends
is what really grew cold, huh?

349
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,055
{\an8}<i>Please return soon, Falin!</i>

350
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,980
