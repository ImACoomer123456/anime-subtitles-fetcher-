1
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,478
DRAGON BONELESS HAM

3
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,272
There's so much meat to process,
I don't know if we can consume it all.

4
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,933
There you are.

5
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,854
What's with your form?

6
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,941
I thought I assigned you the task
of searching for His Majesty.

7
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,903
{\an8}I don't recall permitting you
to take a break.

8
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,994
What was that noise?

9
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,247
Looks like the sword
I had propped up fell over.

10
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,958
You should tie it in place.

11
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,295
Falin?

12
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,214
Marcille.

13
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,009
Where did Falin go?

14
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,511
Huh?

15
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,347
Senshi, do you know
where Falin took off to?

16
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,516
I haven't seen anyone walk by.

17
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,769
What is it? Is something wrong?

18
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,397
Don't tell me...

19
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,609
she left through this window.

20
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,071
I'll go take a look outside.

21
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,531
Huh?

22
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,375
What the...

23
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,628
Falin!

24
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:34,881
Are you okay?

25
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,674
What happened...

26
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,554
What happened here?

27
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,309
{\an8}Lord Delgal... I have to look for him.

28
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,561
Delgal? Who's that?

29
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,896
Everything...

30
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,815
Everything that exists on this earth,

31
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:59,405
every building, gold coin,
citizen, cattle, blood, flesh...

32
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,494
Even the grain of sand beneath your feet,

33
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:10,625
belongs to His Majesty, King Delgal.

34
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,922
You dirty thief.

35
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,425
I remember spotting you,

36
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,845
skulking inside the paintings.

37
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,389
<i>He remembers me?</i>

38
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>The King?</i>

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,684
<i>Inside the paintings?</i>

40
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,854
Who are you? What is your purpose?

41
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>He's the lord of the dungeon...</i>

42
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,822
<i>The lunatic magician!</i>

43
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,912
H-Hey, you! Step back!

44
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,205
Next time, I won't miss!

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,086
You damn usurpers!

46
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,297
Falin, can you get up?

47
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,464
Falin!

48
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,842
{\an8}Shut up!

49
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,597
{\an8}Laios!

50
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,349
What incredible strength.

51
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,102
What the hell is going on?

52
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,603
Is that guy an adventurer?

53
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,524
Huh? What's with the book?

54
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,609
I've got a really bad feeling about this.

55
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,904
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

56
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,865
Is it just me,
or is he chanting something?

57
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,535
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

58
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,120
This incantation...

59
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:33,624
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

60
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,501
<i>It's ancient magic!</i>

61
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,878
Devour!

62
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,431
<i>Explosive spells, defense magic,</i>

63
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,558
<i>none of that can halt this attack!</i>

64
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,934
<i>In that case...</i>

65
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,568
<i>I'll directly overwrite the spell!</i>

66
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,452
Cancel!

67
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,002
Cancel!

68
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,338
<i>This ancient magic...</i>

69
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,341
<i>I can understand and decipher it, but!</i>

70
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,014
<i>I can't keep up with it!</i>

71
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,520
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

72
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,526
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

73
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,788
A-Are you the maker of this dungeon?

74
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,041
I'd like to have a chat with...

75
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,313
No need to fear.

76
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,315
The traitors have gone.

77
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,570
His Majesty will return soon.

78
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,364
When he does,
let us hold a grand celebration.

79
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,951
Hey, Dragon.

80
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,956
This form must be inconvenient for you.

81
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,209
I'll provide you with a new one.

82
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,720
Do what needs to be done.

83
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,973
As you command.

84
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,394
Ow.

85
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,812
What's going on?

86
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,398
Hold on, I'll provide light.

87
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,737
What is this place?

88
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,323
{\an8}Where did we fall from, anyway?

89
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
{\an8}What the heck? Where's the exit...

90
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,245
What now?

91
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,789
I think the walls are closing in!

92
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,500
You've got to be kidding me! Dammit!

93
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,335
The exit! Search for an exit!

94
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,628
Where?!

95
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,004
Can't you magic us out of here?

96
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,256
Using what magic exactly?

97
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,891
<i>We're going to die.</i>

98
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,435
<i>It's not my first time dying,</i>

99
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,646
<i>but no one will find us
under these stones.</i>

100
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,107
<i>I finally reunited with Falin</i>

101
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,568
<i>and took a step closer
to unraveling the dungeon's mystery.</i>

102
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,154
<i>Now all of that is going to mean nothing!</i>

103
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,990
<i>I don't want to die like this!</i>

104
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,454
Marcille!

105
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,042
It's a hole! We can escape through here!

106
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,003
We don't know where it leads!

107
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,047
Anything's better than getting squashed!

108
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,550
Just hurry!

109
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,768
Where are we?

110
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,436
It's freezing!

111
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,440
Anyway, we've got to get out of here.

112
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,441
Not happening.

113
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,153
I can't even budge a finger.

114
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,947
You have to try.

115
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,032
If that guy finds us again...

116
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,875
<i>We're toast.</i>

117
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,473
T-They vanished.

118
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,102
Damn, it feels like
my head's about to explode.

119
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,356
Senshi, wake Laios up.

120
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,026
I'll scout around this area.

121
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,199
Get him!

122
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,035
Where did these bastards sneak in from?

123
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,870
There's a long-ears too!

124
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,205
-He went that way!
-You little!

125
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,374
Quiet!

126
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,792
What's the matter?

127
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,377
Moles, Captain.

128
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,171
How did they get in?

129
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,964
What were the guards doing?

130
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,925
{\an8}We're not sure.

131
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,427
{\an8}<i>The hole is sealed.</i>

132
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,887
{\an8}Whatever.

133
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,555
A little man,

134
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,891
a depths-dweller,

135
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,394
a long-legs, and a long-ears!

136
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,063
Interesting.

137
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,775
I've never killed a long-ears before.
I'll handle it.

138
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,277
Give the little man to the dogs.

139
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,279
They're craving some entertainment.

140
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:56,697
Wait.

141
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,534
You are Chief Zon's sister, aren't you?

142
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,081
We have come to fulfill
our promise to your chief.

143
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,291
We ask that you treat us kindly.

144
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,044
{\an8}How do you know that name?

145
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,129
Huh?

146
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,926
You're the vegetable seller!

147
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,678
You smelled different,
so we didn't recognize you!

148
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,182
What brings you all the way down here?

149
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,726
{\an8}What promise did you make to our Chief?

150
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,687
I see.

151
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,524
So that's what happened.

152
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,611
I was curious why the Dragon
had disappeared all of a sudden.

153
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,989
I thank you on behalf of the Chief.

154
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,533
Prepare the concoction.

155
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,376
It's ready.

156
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,087
ORC CONCOCTION

157
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,232
U-Um...

158
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,110
I'm just...

159
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,487
out of...

160
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,614
magic...

161
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,748
H-Hey.

162
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,626
We were attacked by an elf magician.

163
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,629
Do you know anything about him?

164
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,964
You've encountered him?

165
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,843
He had brown skin and silver hair...

166
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,886
That's the one.

167
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,638
We don't know a lot about him.

168
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,392
He's been around
long before we settled here.

169
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,644
And it seems he's the one
governing this dungeon.

170
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,399
Whenever outsiders
excessively meddle with the dungeon,

171
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,401
that's when he shows up.

172
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:02,239
<i>He creates monsters,
controls them at will, alters the terrain,</i>

173
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,493
<i>and can kill any creature
by simply flipping through his book.</i>

174
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,913
{\an8}The ruler of the dungeon...

175
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,914
{\an8}That means...

176
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,418
we've caught the attention
of the lunatic magician!

177
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,753
That's no joke!

178
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,506
Damn, we've got to get out of here fast!

179
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,467
Was it Marcille's magic that lured him?

180
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,928
No, maybe it's because
we took down the Red Dragon.

181
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,806
He has a few monsters under his command,

182
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,684
and when you kill them,
you end up ticking him off.

183
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,811
So that's what my brother
was worried about,

184
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:37,191
and why he warned us not to mess
with the Red Dragon.

185
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,610
My brother is always right.

186
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,153
<i>That bastard!</i>

187
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,824
Once these two wake up,
they'll want to find Falin for sure.

188
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,327
But I have to make them give up somehow.

189
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,079
How?

190
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,580
Anything that does the trick!

191
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,915
We can burn Marcille's staff

192
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,334
or tell them we spotted Falin
heading to the surface.

193
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,754
Or that we should be content
after having Dragon meat.

194
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,715
{\an8}So, you're proposing we deceive them?

195
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,175
I am!

196
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,720
Otherwise, these idiots
would never let it go!

197
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,015
If we go any deeper,
we're definitely going to get killed.

198
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,725
Do you want to become a part of the wall?

199
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,477
Because I sure don't!

200
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,112
{\an8}I have no intention of joining them
just to end up dead.

201
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,739
Hey,

202
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,367
I want to go retrieve my stuff
that I left behind.

203
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,995
Could you show me the way?

204
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,832
No way.

205
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,751
I don't want the stench of spinelessness
rubbing off on me.

206
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,338
I ask you as well.

207
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,257
Please take him there.

208
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,385
{\an8}He might be faint-hearted,
but he's not a bad fellow.

209
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,013
{\an8}Senshi, aren't you coming with me?

210
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,641
One of us should stay with those two.

211
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,809
But...

212
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,649
You know I can't say no to you.

213
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,736
I'd rather not, but I'll show him the way.

214
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,952
<i>Damn it.</i>

215
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>They're a bunch of fools,
every last one of them!</i>

216
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,083
Did you get separated from a companion?

217
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,919
Yeah.

218
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:24,548
The last we saw of her, she was lying
on the ground near the magician's feet.

219
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,926
It's tough to be hopeful about that.

220
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,763
That doesn't justify
lying to your friends.

221
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,350
Easy for someone on the outside to say.

222
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,227
No, forget I said that!

223
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,021
Behind you.

224
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,439
Huh?

225
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,279
Don't panic.

226
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,197
It's cold!

227
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,783
That's one of the city's residents.

228
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,370
The spirits here are still sane

229
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,122
and only appear when they want to be seen.

230
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,417
The routes they take are safe.

231
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,585
Let's follow.

232
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,544
Huh?

233
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,715
You better be right.

234
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,646
{\an8}That's the place
we were at a little while ago.

235
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,315
The Red Dragon is gone.

236
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,152
It didn't resurrect, did it?

237
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,070
No.

238
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,156
{\an8}The dogs aren't on high alert.

239
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,326
{\an8}Either the magician made it disappear
or took it with him.

240
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,162
There are traces of an explosion, though.

241
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,083
We started a fire near
the Dragon's fuel bag, and it ignited.

242
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,085
I'm surprised you survived that.

243
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,548
One of our party members
quickly shielded us with defense magic,

244
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,216
<i>so we were unharmed.</i>

245
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,677
You're lucky to have such friends.

246
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,596
You're not getting it.

247
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,142
Even she didn't know
she could use that magic.

248
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,728
We could've all blown up, healer included.

249
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,856
Ultimately, the magic worked,

250
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,650
but if it had failed,
it would have made her a fool.

251
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,486
They're all like that.

252
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,244
How did you manage to defeat
the Red Dragon on your own, anyway?

253
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,208
{\an8}Senshi and I distracted it,
and Laios, the tall-man in our party,

254
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,587
{\an8}jumped into the Red Dragon's chest
and struck its weak point.

255
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,630
That's impressive.

256
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,259
A warrior should have courage.

257
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,595
<i>It wasn't courage.</i>

258
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,891
{\an8}It turned out okay,
but it was a stupid gamble.

259
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,810
<i>Honestly, it sent shivers down my spine.</i>

260
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,105
<i>Someone who'd make that kind of call,
there's no telling where they'll end up!</i>

261
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,734
<i>There were a few members
who left our party,</i>

262
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,573
but looking back,
maybe they were the smarter ones.

263
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,911
I should have been less stubborn
and followed suit as well.

264
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,291
Are you saying it would have been better
to lose your friends?

265
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,127
I don't know.

266
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,507
{\an8}Maybe my decision to join Laios

267
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,176
made it harder for him to back out.

268
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,555
Anyway, what happened after that?

269
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,017
We healed our wounds
and patched ourselves up.

270
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,269
And in this room...

271
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,985
We cooked up the Dragon's meat and ate it.

272
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,070
As you should.

273
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,447
It's your rightful reward
for bringing it down.

274
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,787
Was it after that
when the magician showed up?

275
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,581
How did you manage
to survive the encounter?

276
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,545
The mage in our party
held up against his attacks.

277
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,797
That long-ears?

278
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,258
She seemed so clueless, though.

279
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,051
{\an8}Trust me, she is.

280
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,303
She used some shady magic back there.

281
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,766
Even if she makes it out of the dungeon,
I doubt she could lead a decent life.

282
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,437
They're stupid idiots.
Every last one of them.

283
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,273
{\an8}They're a bunch of fools.

284
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,776
They believe that if they
try hard enough, they'll be rewarded.

285
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,988
How am I supposed to reason
with folks like that?

286
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,699
So, you're going to trick them?

287
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,160
There must be a better way.

288
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,039
If a couple of lies get me back
on the surface, I'm all for it!

289
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,457
I'm a coward, after all!

290
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,419
My life comes first, over everything!

291
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,671
Don't be like that.

292
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,843
Just admit you don't want to see them die.

293
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,442
What's this sucker doing here?

294
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,653
Did it crawl all the way up here?

295
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,537
Turns out, you were the smartest among us.

296
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,959
<i>Bloodstains...</i>

297
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,879
Like someone dragged a body along...

298
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,631
Hey.

299
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,965
Do you want to be left behind?

300
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,092
C-Coming.

301
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,601
I grabbed our stuff.

302
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
What do you think you're doing?!

303
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,857
You need to stay put!

304
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,150
I'm not feeling any pain.

305
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,028
That's because the medicine
is messing with your sense of pain!

306
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,864
{\an8}Falin should still be nearby!

307
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,034
Calm down.

308
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,000
I've got something to say to you both.

309
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,921
Chilchuck, I've been thinking, and...

310
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,632
Let me go first.

311
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,760
Laios,

312
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,682
I can't even begin to imagine
how you must be feeling.

313
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,936
{\an8}But we can't continue
the search like this.

314
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,440
{\an8}It's going to end up
with one of us kicking the bucket.

315
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,610
Please, Laios.

316
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,198
{\an8}Please be strong for now
and head back above ground!

317
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,826
I don't want to lose you guys!

318
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,121
My feelings might not match
the affection you have for your sister,

319
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,706
but I've got the three of you to lose!

320
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,208
Informing the Lord of the Island
about the lunatic magician

321
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,418
may prompt some action.

322
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,087
Maybe we could gather funds
to enlist help!

323
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,174
{\an8}With enough preparation,
we can reach this level quicker next time!

324
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,970
So, please...

325
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,349
Let's head back, Laios.

326
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,355
To tell you the truth,

327
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,860
we're running short
on seasoning and other ingredients.

328
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:04,239
I want to make sure we can whip up
something delicious for Falin.

329
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,117
We should head back to the city
and replenish our supplies.

330
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,205
I've sent word
that the Red Dragon's been slain.

331
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,125
My brother should return
with the others soon.

332
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,629
When you're ready and return down here,

333
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,425
we'll do what we can to help you out.

334
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,721
{\an8}All right.

335
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,435
Forgive me for making you worry.

336
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,897
Let's head back.

337
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,816
Yeah.

338
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,949
