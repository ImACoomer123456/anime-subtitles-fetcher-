1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,813
<i>Laios and his crew agreed
to head back to the surface.</i>

3
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,856
<i>I don't want to lose you guys!</i>

4
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>You guys...</i>

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,945
<i>The strength of their bonds
was reaffirmed.</i>

6
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>A little earlier...</i>

7
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,326
Are you awake now?

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,578
Do you feel any discomfort?

9
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,581
You seem well enough.

10
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,543
You were low on blood,
so I used some goat blood.

11
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,794
But it's not ideal.

12
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,672
You should head back to town.

13
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,801
If you had stayed dead on the water,
you'd be fish bait by now.

14
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,804
You should thank whoever pulled you out.

15
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,848
Do you think it was...

16
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,099
Kuro!

17
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,354
I recognize these scents.

18
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:31,860
An elf, a tall-man,
a half-foot, and a dwarf.

19
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,653
The same folks who took our treasure.

20
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,446
I suspected it was them!

21
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,827
I require a revival fee.

22
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,705
I'll only charge you for the goat.

23
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,250
Right, I remember now.

24
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,752
We were attacked by Fish-men and...

25
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,344
So, we died again.

26
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,972
This will do.

27
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,057
<i>Are they adventurers?</i>

28
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,562
Are you...

29
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,480
What?

30
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,733
Nothing.

31
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,776
Let's go, Namari.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,028
Yeah, coming.

33
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,241
You're even making eyes at a dwarf?

34
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,452
You have no standards.

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,998
Well, I've never picked my friends
based on how tall they are.

36
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,916
Is that so?

37
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,668
Our provisions are gone!

38
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,921
They must've stolen from us again!

39
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,838
Food.

40
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,214
How dare they!

41
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,758
Not again.

42
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,886
They've taken our food but left our money?

43
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,222
Maybe they've depleted their own supplies.

44
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,681
Infuriating.

45
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,767
We need to take them to task.

46
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,227
What do we do, Kabru?

47
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,521
We've got no other option.

48
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,648
Let's head back to town.

49
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,483
What? Seriously?

50
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,068
Without catching the thieves?

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,905
We're out of provisions,
so we can't push on.

52
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,115
Let's admit our own lack of skills.

53
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,785
Just like those people said,

54
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,120
we should be thankful
we're still breathing.

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,501
If that's your call, Kabru, I'm with you.

56
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,627
Same here.

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,214
If you promise you won't forget
about finding those thieves,

58
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,632
I'll follow your lead.

59
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,884
You have my word, Rin.

60
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,095
Kuro will follow Mickbell.

61
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,851
{\an8}We're going to be deep in the red
after this expedition.

62
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,361
It's getting foggy.

63
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,863
Everyone, watch out...

64
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,288
<i>This isn't a natural fog.</i>

65
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,290
<i>Could a monster be causing this?</i>

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>A Fish-man?</i>

67
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>Where did they come from?</i>

68
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>Dammit. I'll have to fight.</i>

69
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:07,932
<i>Here it comes!</i>

70
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,275
<i>The way it wields its axe
like it's mowing something down...</i>

71
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,903
<i>I know it very well.</i>

72
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,072
<i>Yes.</i>

73
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,574
<i>It's...</i>

74
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,997
Shh!

75
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,624
It's okay. Calm down.

76
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,710
Daya, it's me.

77
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,715
<i>This fog is illusion magic.</i>

78
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,761
<i>The confused one
with the drawn weapon has to be Kuro.</i>

79
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,597
<i>And the one standing in a daze is Holm.</i>

80
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,600
<i>He tends to freeze
when too much happens all at once.</i>

81
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,561
<i>And the one who bolted earlier
must be Mick.</i>

82
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,148
<i>In that case, the biggest threat here is...</i>

83
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,525
<i>Rin.</i>

84
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,778
<i>Just as I feared,
she's chanting something.</i>

85
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,281
<i>She has the power
to reduce us all to cinders.</i>

86
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,160
<i>The only way to peacefully
interrupt a mage's incantation is...</i>

87
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,542
{\an8}Rinsha.

88
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,337
Do you see? This is an illusion.

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,049
<i>It's a shame she's
in the form of a monster.</i>

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,553
<i>Now then, how do we
dispel this illusionary fog?</i>

91
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,982
<i>It's not this one.</i>

92
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,819
<i>A spellcaster wouldn't
come charging with a weapon.</i>

93
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,572
<i>They'd observe from a distance.</i>

94
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>That one!</i>

95
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,117
What?

96
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,839
You got us.

97
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,840
We surrender.

98
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,051
Let him go, will you?

99
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,262
These guys...

100
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,348
<i>They are the corpse retrievers
we ran into on the upper floor!</i>

101
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,143
This isn't a chance reunion, is it?

102
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,894
You were following us, right?

103
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,021
What do you mean?

104
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,233
Retrieving bodies
in the lower levels pays better,

105
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,152
thanks to Island subsidies.

106
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,990
<i>We were intent
on getting our stolen loot back</i>

107
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,367
<i>and entered a level we weren't ready for.</i>

108
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,120
All they had to do
was leisurely follow our trail

109
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,414
for more lucrative corpses.

110
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,874
Oh.

111
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,292
Infuriating.

112
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,960
But you guys were a little too slow.

113
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,338
<i>By the time you found us,
we were already resurrected</i>

114
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,466
<i>and on our way back to the surface.</i>

115
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,594
<i>You got antsy
and resorted to extreme measures.</i>

116
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,888
<i>You used magic
to make us turn on each other.</i>

117
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,764
Close, but not quite.

118
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,767
Actually, it would've been ideal
if you caught up with your thieves

119
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,562
and fought with them
and killed each other.

120
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,522
But what a letdown.

121
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,276
We didn't think you'd get taken out
by monsters so quickly.

122
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,403
You...!

123
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,324
Stealing from and attacking
fellow adventurers is a serious offense.

124
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,367
I'll be reporting this
to the Lord of the Island.

125
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,038
How about we make a deal?

126
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,832
Going back empty-handed
would be a loss for you.

127
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,711
Two of our comrades
are lying dead over there.

128
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,589
Take them to the resurrection office.

129
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,133
You should be able to make a tidy sum.

130
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,802
They're only unconscious.

131
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,891
I'll testify that they
were attacked by Fish-men.

132
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,018
Our share would be...

133
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,895
Let's see, 40...

134
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,523
No, 30% will do.

135
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:44,941
What do you say?

136
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,776
It's not a bad deal for you.

137
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,197
Fine. Deal.

138
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,408
Kabru...

139
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,672
You bastard!

140
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,715
I'm not surprised.

141
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,925
That's our Kabru!

142
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,314
Humans really are easy to kill.

143
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:30,278
Tall-man, dwarf, gnome,
they all share the same weak points.

144
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,488
Even their movements are similar.

145
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,116
If only monsters were the same,
it'd make things simpler.

146
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,578
Kuro, could you go find Mick?

147
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,662
Woof!

148
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,746
Kabru.

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,331
What do we do with him?

150
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,709
P-Please let me go.

151
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,502
I didn't know anything!

152
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,339
You don't care about
breaking the curse on the dungeon

153
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,758
or exterminating monsters.

154
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,513
More and more people are making
a quick buck by robbing others.

155
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,891
At this rate, decent people
will leave the Island.

156
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,647
That's why
I can't forgive people like you.

157
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,399
Please don't.

158
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,585
Kabru.

159
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,047
Sorry about what I did earlier.

160
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,715
It was the only thing I could think of.

161
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,093
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,928
I don't know and I don't care to know.

163
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,180
That's a relief.

164
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,517
I'm growing impatient,
and we're not making much progress.

165
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,977
You're right.

166
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,188
And this is where our impatience led us.

167
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,814
It sucks.

168
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,317
Can't you offer some encouragement
once in a while?

169
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,611
There's no use sugarcoating it.

170
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,821
This is the reality of our abilities.

171
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,951
The Lord of the Island only sees
the dungeon as a profitable pit.

172
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,037
Even if it runs out of treasure,

173
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,748
he believes he can get by
on monster hides and bones.

174
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,127
But the truth is, no one will enter
the dungeon once it's fully explored.

175
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,214
Either because
there's no fortune to be made

176
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,800
or because it doesn't excite
the adventurous spirit.

177
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,428
Fewer and fewer people will be here.

178
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,932
<i>Monsters will spill out
from the dungeon and attack citizens.</i>

179
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,311
That's how many settlements
have fallen into ruin.

180
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,648
We must lift the curse
on the dungeon quickly.

181
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,484
There's no room for monsters
or dungeons in this world.

182
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,027
Yeah.

183
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,614
I'm hungry.

184
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,575
Being resurrected
makes you hungry, doesn't it?

185
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,494
Kabru!

186
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,622
{\an8}Those guys had
quite a bit of valuables on them!

187
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,915
All right.

188
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,709
Take their food,
but toss the rest into the lake.

189
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,711
What? Are you serious?

190
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,299
If we took their valuables,
we'd be no better than them.

191
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,594
Once that's done, let's have a light meal.

192
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,596
-Sounds good.
-Sounds good.

193
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,932
ADVENTURERS' RATIONS
SALTED MEAT

194
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,017
BREAD, WINE, NUTS AND DRIED FRUITS

195
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,019
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

196
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,771
Yum!

197
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,815
They're eating pretty well.

198
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,025
Corpse retrievers
make a pretty penny, huh?

199
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,195
Especially if they're the ones creating
the corpses and bringing them back.

200
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,656
But won't the Lord of the Island catch on?

201
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,160
There's a screening process
to claim rewards from the Island.

202
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,413
They must've been pretty clever
to slip through that.

203
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:33,502
Or maybe they're in cahoots
with more parties than we realize.

204
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,921
That's so rotten.

205
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,424
In the end, they're just
digging their own grave.

206
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,176
Will you inform the Lord of the Island?

207
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,679
I doubt that Lord will come up
with a good solution.

208
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,057
Newbies like Doni will end up
getting the short end of the stick.

209
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,811
If only that stupid Lord
gains so much weight that he pops.

210
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,064
Then the elves will come swooping in.

211
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,318
We still need him
to hold out as a bulwark.

212
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:03,324
Anyway, a tall-man, a dwarf,
a half-foot, and an elf, huh?

213
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,575
What's this about?

214
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,078
The party that cast
a ghost-warding spell on us.

215
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,206
You mean those treasure thieves.

216
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,999
Food robbers.

217
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,877
There aren't many parties with an elf.

218
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,087
We could identify them
with some narrowing down.

219
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,590
Do you think it's Doni and Fionil?

220
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,177
It's hard to imagine them
venturing down to the third floor.

221
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,555
And I find it odd
that they're only a party of four.

222
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,599
It's rather reckless of them.

223
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,768
Rin, Holm.

224
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,103
Do you notice anything
about this ghost-warding spell?

225
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,897
You still have it on?

226
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,857
I mean, it's evidence.

227
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm not familiar with spells like that.

228
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,862
Let me take a look.

229
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,284
It screams "honor student."

230
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,912
It looks like it's
straight out of a textbook.

231
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,122
And whoever did it wasn't used to it.

232
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,500
They might even be
a magic school graduate.

233
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,795
All graduates produce similar spells.

234
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,673
And there's no doubt
it's the work of an elf.

235
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,384
Magic school...

236
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,388
Hmm, magic school, huh?

237
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,681
Interesting.

238
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,890
What? What is it?

239
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,102
Well, I have a hunch
about whose party this might be.

240
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,646
It's just a guess, but

241
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,940
I'd be thrilled if I'm right.

242
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,859
Out with it. Cut the drama.

243
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,152
Well,

244
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,488
{\an8}I think it's the party
with the Touden siblings.

245
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,824
Touden? You mean those two?

246
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,743
They don't strike me as the criminal type.

247
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,911
What's your reasoning?

248
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:35,916
First, if I remember correctly,
the sister is a magic school graduate.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,878
But the one who cast
the ghost-warding spell was an elf.

250
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,713
And those siblings are tall-men.

251
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,299
Hold on, let me finish.

252
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,303
<i>The elf in their party
seemed pretty close to the sister,</i>

253
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,389
<i>as if they were childhood friends.</i>

254
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,393
<i>So I figured they must've attended
the same magic school.</i>

255
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,188
Magic school graduates
are rare around here,

256
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,815
especially if they're an elf.

257
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,152
I suppose it's possible.

258
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,862
But it's not enough to go on.

259
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,282
Plus, Kuro only smelled one tall-man.

260
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,200
If they're siblings,
he should've smelled two.

261
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,455
{\an8}Are you suggesting that's why
they're venturing with a small group?

262
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,374
{\an8}Exactly! One of the siblings got lost,

263
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,711
{\an8}and there was a disagreement in the party
about whether to rescue them.

264
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,715
I think so because we just crossed paths
with a former member of their group.

265
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,761
<i>They had disputes over their goals
and income even before this.</i>

266
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,389
<i>And maybe this incident
led some of them to leave.</i>

267
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,059
<i>Now desperate, they're resorting
to stealing treasure and food.</i>

268
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,479
-You're starting to convince me.
-Right?

269
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,858
But Kuro, you mentioned
catching a whiff of a dwarf too.

270
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,985
I did. Strong dwarf scent.

271
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,403
That's odd then.

272
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,405
Why would they still
have a dwarf with them?

273
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,658
Maybe they recruited another one.

274
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,744
Who else is in their party?

275
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,745
Let's see.

276
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,164
<i>The tall-men are Laios, Falin,</i>

277
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,875
<i>and probably Shuro, an Easterner.</i>

278
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,002
<i>There's Namari, the dwarf we saw earlier,</i>

279
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,170
<i>and Marcille the elf.</i>

280
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,840
<i>I think the half-foot's name
was Chilchuck or something.</i>

281
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,802
<i>Assuming this is
the Touden siblings' party,</i>

282
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,138
<i>one of their siblings,
as well as Shuro and Namari, departed.</i>

283
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,557
<i>And another dwarf joined them, I think.</i>

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,770
I see. So the woman back there was Namari.

285
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,065
Do you know anything about her, Daya?

286
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,441
Only her name.

287
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,567
She's pretty well-known.

288
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,195
She's the only daughter of a guy
known as the "Arms Dealer."

289
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,571
"Arms Dealer"?

290
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,658
He used to control
the arms trade on this Island.

291
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,079
<i>But one day, he was found
embezzling a hefty sum and vanished.</i>

292
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,081
<i>They say he's one of the reasons</i>

293
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,417
<i>the Lord of the Island
has a negative view of dwarves now.</i>

294
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,628
A lot of dwarves suffered because of him.

295
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,422
Including me.

296
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,676
No honorable dwarf
would want to follow in his footsteps.

297
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,928
{\an8}So maybe she's not an honorable dwarf.

298
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,848
{\an8}The scent I caught was intense.

299
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,892
{\an8}I know something about this Chilchuck guy.

300
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,686
{\an8}He's a middle-aged fellow,

301
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,064
{\an8}but he acts like he's the representative
for all the half-foots on this Island.

302
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,027
<i>He's a greedy guy who insists
on making contracts through the guild</i>

303
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,071
<i>and paying broker fees.</i>

304
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,450
I want no part of that,
so I'm steering clear.

305
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,579
I mean, if he found out I hired a Kobold,
I'd get an earful for sure.

306
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,205
You wouldn't want that, right?

307
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,458
You want me to keep hiring you, don't you?

308
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,001
Mick gives me food.

309
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,210
Mick is a good boss.

310
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,882
I bet he's working him hard
for measly wages.

311
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,968
Holm, you shouldn't
make assumptions like that.

312
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,722
{\an8}Anyway, Rin, the Eastern tall-man
is from your neck of the woods.

313
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,432
Maybe you know each other.

314
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,475
Oh, please.

315
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,810
Don't group us together
just because we're both Easterners.

316
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,772
Depending on the region,
we don't even speak the same language.

317
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,566
And Shuro isn't a name from my island.

318
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,486
I might have more information on him then.

319
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,739
<i>He was a bit of a loner
even in Touden's crew.</i>

320
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>He came to the Island
with a few other Easterners,</i>

321
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,744
<i>then joined Touden's party alone.</i>

322
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,288
<i>He gave off this vibe
that he wasn't your average person,</i>

323
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,249
<i>and it seemed like he was venturing
into the dungeon to test his skills.</i>

324
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,127
But he left the party, huh?

325
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,506
He didn't strike me as someone
concerned about rewards or dangers.

326
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,593
Could it be that both siblings left,
and he's still in the party?

327
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,886
Nah, that's unlikely.

328
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,556
Kabru, you remember details about people
to the point where it's creepy.

329
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,141
Why do you sound so excited?

330
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,644
Because it's fun. It's really exciting!

331
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,524
There are countless people on this Island,
each with their own motives.

332
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,777
But when their entirely
different actions intersect,

333
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,197
it sparks a historic event
involving a whole lot of people.

334
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,324
I thought this was just
a boring case of theft,

335
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,910
but I sense something interesting
is about to happen.

336
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,871
I hope this crew
is the Touden siblings' party.

337
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,666
Because for a long time now,

338
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,919
I've been itching
to see their true colors revealed.

339
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,171
{\an8}Do you have a grudge
against them or something?

340
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,173
It's not like they've wronged me.

341
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,885
<i>In the past, Laios apparently
made a fortune in a gold-peeling crew.</i>

342
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,971
<i>But he was sharing most of his earnings</i>

343
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,182
<i>with comrades who couldn't enter
the dungeon due to illness or injury.</i>

344
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,184
{\an8}That's noble of him.

345
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,019
Yes, it's a touching story.

346
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,188
But there's more to it.

347
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,192
<i>His comrades had long recovered,
but kept taking the money.</i>

348
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,195
<i>In the end,
they never returned to adventuring</i>

349
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,948
<i>and now peddle
smuggled goods on the Island.</i>

350
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,368
"I shall bestow everything to whoever
defeats the lord of the dungeon."

351
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,788
That's what some king-like figure
of this country supposedly said.

352
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,917
{\an8}Regardless of whether you could
truly obtain everything or not,

353
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,588
{\an8}this dungeon itself
is a legacy left by ancient elves.

354
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,465
{\an8}I'm sure it holds significant power.

355
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:40,012
That's why I don't think it should
fall into the hands of those siblings.

356
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,472
<i>They're not saints.</i>

357
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,266
<i>They're just indifferent to people.</i>

358
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,768
<i>Just like the Lord of the Island.</i>

359
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,313
We know, Kabru.

360
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,732
We believe you're the only one.

361
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,234
The only one to drive out
that stupid Lord as well.

362
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,237
{\an8}But if you're still struggling
with monsters in this area,

363
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,489
{\an8}you've got a long road ahead of you.

364
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,283
You're right.

365
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,410
Well then, shall we get going soon?

366
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,205
May we make it back without any issues.

367
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,961
Whoa! That was close!

368
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:13,879
Blade Fish!

369
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,590
Don't let them distract you!

370
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,383
Watch your step!

371
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,848
<i>A Kraken? No, it's a Sea Serpent!</i>

372
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,099
Rin! Get back!

373
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,267
Incant...

374
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,269
Holm!

375
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,730
I can't summon her in this situation!

376
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,482
There's no telling
what might get mixed in!

377
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,987
<i>Don't panic.</i>

378
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,073
<i>It's up to you to do something, Kabru.</i>

379
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,992
<i>It's not a creature
that makes complicated movements.</i>

380
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,371
<i>Observe its motions,
and aim for its carotid artery.</i>

381
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,290
<i>Wait, where's its carotid artery?</i>

382
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,250
Excuse me.

383
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,128
Tade!

384
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,296
On it!

385
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,469
Young Master, it's in your court!

386
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,519
Young Master!

387
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,146
That was impressive.

388
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,232
Is your armor damaged?

389
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,149
No.

390
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,359
You must be weary.

391
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,444
How about something to eat?

392
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,280
No. Let's press forward.

393
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,283
What are we going to do
with the Young Master?

394
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,577
He's completely besotted
with that Northern girl.

395
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,539
Tade is hungry.

396
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,874
Kabru, are you hurt?

397
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,209
Change of plans.

398
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,462
It might be tasty stewed with daikon!

399
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,172
-That's dumb.
-Excuse me.

400
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,926
You saved me back there. Thank you.

401
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,261
I'm Kabru.

402
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,138
May I ask your names?

403
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,431
Don't mention it.

404
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,182
We were just passing through.

405
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,935
If I'm not mistaken,

406
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,438
you're searching for a woman.

407
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,566
D-Do you know something?

408
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,153
Just as I thought. My deepest sympathies.

409
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,072
I might be able to assist you

410
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,159
in your search for Falin Touden.

411
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,411
Stop it, Kuro!

412
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,830
Didn't I tell you
not to make that expression?

413
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,998
It's frightening!

414
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,375
What's gotten into you?

415
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,169
<i>And so, Kabru and his crew</i>

416
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,921
<i>decided to venture deeper
into the dungeon once again.</i>

417
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,006
NOW

418
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,467
<i>Turning back time to Laios and his party,</i>

419
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,969
<i>two full days have passed
since they agreed to head back.</i>

420
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,430
It's a dead end.

421
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,432
Another dead end.

422
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,894
I'm famished.

423
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,353
I'm exhausted.

424
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,438
I'm parched.

425
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,816
<i>They were lost and on the brink of death.</i>

426
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,950
