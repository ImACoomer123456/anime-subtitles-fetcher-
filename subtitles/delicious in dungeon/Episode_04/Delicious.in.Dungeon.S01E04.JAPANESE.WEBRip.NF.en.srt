1
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>On the third basement floor
of the dungeon,</i>

3
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,066
<i>through the underground graveyard
and past the forest of the spire,</i>

4
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,860
<i>you reach the Golden Castle.</i>

5
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,322
<i>The once splendid castle</i>

6
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,534
<i>is now covered in mold and dust
and is a shadow of what it used to be.</i>

7
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,870
<i>The footsteps that come
as if from nowhere,</i>

8
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>could they belong to an adventurer?</i>

9
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,416
<i>Or could they belong to a former resident
who has passed away</i>

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,168
<i>but is still wandering around?</i>

11
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,255
That's a skeleton.

12
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,384
And they're humans.

13
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,888
That's a ghoul.

14
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,141
How can you tell? You're creeping me out!

15
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,643
The footsteps of a living creature,
bones, and something rotten

16
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,894
are totally different.

17
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,192
Let's go left.

18
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,444
The Golem seems to be wary
of what's on the right.

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>A Golem is a human-shaped magical creature
made of mud, dirt, and stone.</i>

20
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,829
<i>It is used as a puppet
that faithfully follows</i>

21
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>its master's commands.</i>

22
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,373
Stop.

23
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,711
For your information, Golems are 99% dirt!

24
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,087
They aren't edible!

25
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,172
They are genuinely magical creatures!

26
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,049
I even know how to make them!

27
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,926
-Teach me!
-No!

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,804
{\an8}What do you want to use them for
after you learn how to make them?

29
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,558
What I'm interested in is their bodies.

30
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,893
Follow me.

31
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,566
This is the campsite
I usually use as my base.

32
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,486
You live here?

33
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,780
I hardly sleep here.

34
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,367
I usually hunt
on the second or fourth floor,

35
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,955
and once a month, I shop for seasoning
and other things I lack in town.

36
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,751
<i>It was on my way back
from a shopping trip that I met you folks.</i>

37
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,504
There are only a few monsters
you can eat on the third floor.

38
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,717
They are mostly decayed or just bones.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,968
But...

40
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,720
<i>Golems!</i>

41
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,681
<i>These wonderful creatures are different!</i>

42
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,726
<i>Their bodies are high in nutrition,</i>

43
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,313
and always maintain
the appropriate temperature and humidity.

44
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,441
In other words,

45
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,110
are you using Golems as a garden?

46
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,779
The people in this castle will weep!

47
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,697
And so will scholars of magic!

48
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,199
Why?

49
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:05,286
I don't like magic,
but those creatures deserve praise.

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,956
All gardens should be like that!

51
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,959
<i>After all, they're resistant
to harmful insects.</i>

52
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,003
<i>And they drive away vegetable thieves.</i>

53
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>I don't think
they're after the vegetables.</i>

54
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,467
<i>What's more,
they even control moisture levels.</i>

55
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,552
<i>If you plant seeds and seedlings in them,</i>

56
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,222
<i>they'll take care
of the rest of the cultivation.</i>

57
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,017
That said,
you still have to tend them carefully.

58
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,728
That's why I have my base here.

59
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,829
Here they come!

60
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,831
What now?

61
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,165
-Need our help?
-No need!

62
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,436
Wow.

63
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,812
He's used to this.

64
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,733
How does he know
where the Golem's core is located?

65
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,651
Don't tell me...

66
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,236
It's done.

67
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,865
Harvest the vegetables from the Golems.

68
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:28,286
I thought they were covered in green,
but are these all vegetables?

69
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,497
From a Golem's perspective,
aren't they like parasites?

70
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,961
On the contrary,
the plants' roots make the soil firmer,

71
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,172
so you could say
they're in a symbiotic relationship.

72
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,715
Are you sure?

73
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,134
But please remove the weeds.

74
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,185
What a rich harvest!

75
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,646
Looks like we can finally enjoy
some normal vegetables!

76
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,940
Bring the weeds over here.

77
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,860
Stack them up in this spot
and they will wither.

78
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,944
Once they're withered,

79
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,781
I'll return them to the Golems' bodies,
and they'll naturally decompose.

80
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,078
And this is fertilizer I made elsewhere.

81
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,705
I mix this into the Golems!

82
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,831
I knew it!

83
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,208
You knew what?

84
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,587
{\an8}You knew where the Golems' cores were
because you're the one who planted them!

85
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,464
Unbelievable.

86
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,342
It's illegal to activate
a magical creature without permission!

87
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:29,347
{\an8}All I'm doing is digging up dirt
and putting it back.

88
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,932
{\an8}So, you're bypassing the law!

89
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,352
<i>Stir the soil well and make raised rows.</i>

90
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,939
<i>Planting the same crop repeatedly
leads to monocropping issues,</i>

91
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,358
<i>so sow the seeds in a different Golem.</i>

92
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,362
I'm exhausted.

93
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:48,074
I feel like I used more stamina
than when fighting monsters.

94
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,702
Thanks to your help,
it got done much quicker.

95
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,539
Drinking water
made me want to use the bathroom.

96
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,877
Well then, while that elven girl is gone,

97
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,131
I'll gather up the scattered soil
as much as I can.

98
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,015
Taro, Jiro, Saburo.

99
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,018
Will burying those
make them revive quickly?

100
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,021
No, it takes some time.

101
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>They'll revive
just when the seeds begin to take root,</i>

102
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,444
<i>and the soil stays in place
even when they move around.</i>

103
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,783
He treats the Golems with so much care.

104
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,952
I'm impressed.

105
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,912
So this is how you were living.

106
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,789
Wasn't it tough?

107
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,084
I do it because I like it.

108
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,836
It's not tough at all.

109
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,924
That's about it.

110
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,344
Now, let's enjoy the fruits of our labor!

111
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,558
What a beautiful color.

112
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,561
I've sure gotten better at peeling.

113
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,357
Is this size really okay?

114
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,692
It's perfect.

115
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,113
Are you making fire? I can do it for you.

116
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,073
I'll strike a flint, so it's fine.

117
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,953
You always make a fire like that,
but using magic is faster.

118
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,081
You were just singing the praises
of how convenient Golems are.

119
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,336
When you make something easier,
you may lose your edge in a skill.

120
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,630
Convenience and ease
aren't the same thing.

121
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,092
Your method is no different
from buying vegetables from the store.

122
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,685
This is the last of the Basilisk bacon.

123
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,441
It's done.

124
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,110
FRESH VEGETABLE LUNCH
FROM THE GOLEM GARDEN

125
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,112
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

126
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,496
It's so good!

127
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,374
It's odd to think such tasty vegetables
can grow underground!

128
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,377
I wonder if something inside the Golems
is affecting the flavor.

129
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,461
Stop it!

130
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,297
I don't care if they walk or yell.
They're gardens!

131
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,635
Speaking of which,
Golems are 99% soil, right?

132
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,637
What's the last 1%?

133
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,639
It's a secret.

134
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,935
Phew, that was delicious.

135
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,770
I'm so full.

136
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,147
I'm feeling sleepy after eating so much.

137
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,608
You can rest.

138
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,236
There's a little something
I want to take care of.

139
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,322
Clean up!

140
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,657
I'm going to the toilet.

141
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,786
The toilets around here are so proper.

142
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,914
They aren't some random holes
dug in the ground.

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,376
<i>In busy areas of the dungeon,</i>

144
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,920
<i>there are designated spots
for people to relieve themselves.</i>

145
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,631
{\an8}They're always kept clean,

146
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,175
{\an8}and sometimes
they're even decorated with flowers.

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,428
There must be some diligent people here.

148
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,180
Hm?

149
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,932
Senshi!

150
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,143
What is it?

151
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,311
What are you doing?

152
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:08,024
I'm collecting the feces and urine
and carrying them to the chamber pots.

153
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,443
I'm impressed you can do that
right after a meal.

154
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,487
They serve as crucial fertilizers
down here.

155
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,573
You mean they were also used
for the vegetables...

156
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,910
{\an8}Marcille, they do the same thing
on the surface, too.

157
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,163
{\an8}I know that, but it's still gross.

158
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,084
Why are you so determined
to stick to your life in the dungeon?

159
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,588
If you want a self-sufficient life,
you could have it above ground as well.

160
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:35,551
Don't you think it'd be easier
to cultivate a garden outside and hunt?

161
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:40,264
Then who else will maintain
the toilets in the dungeon?

162
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,894
Who will remove the zombies
that fall inside the toilets?

163
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,813
Who will help up the fallen Golems?

164
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,860
There used to be over ten Golems,
but now there are only three.

165
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,446
<i>Without Golems,</i>

166
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,240
<i>monsters from the lower levels
will climb up here.</i>

167
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,662
<i>And the monsters driven out
by those monsters will enter other places.</i>

168
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,955
<i>And they will drive out other monsters.</i>

169
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,627
<i>If that happens,
this dungeon will be a different place.</i>

170
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,004
<i>You wouldn't be able
to stroll or hunt in here.</i>

171
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,466
The dungeon is just like a garden.

172
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,387
You can't abandon them
and expect to reap their rewards.

173
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,721
More than anything,

174
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:25,810
<i>eating the things that grow here
and giving back to the dungeon...</i>

175
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:31,982
<i>Living like this, I finally feel like
I've truly entered this dungeon.</i>

176
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,443
And that makes me happy.

177
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,989
But if that's the case,

178
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,201
is it okay for you
to leave this place on our behalf?

179
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,620
If this place falls into chaos...

180
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,330
Don't worry about it.

181
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:51,293
Even if I'm away for a month or two,
the Golems will take care of things.

182
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:56,048
Besides, I wouldn't rest easy at night
if you all died from malnutrition.

183
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,049
Give me a minute.

184
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,759
I'll get ready in a hurry.

185
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,892
Senshi is so amazing.

186
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,481
What are you going to do
with these vegetables?

187
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,026
I usually use them for bartering.

188
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,029
Sometimes I set up
an unmanned booth and sell them.

189
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,865
<i>An unmanned booth?</i>

190
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,285
<i>I used to collect the money
in a treasure box,</i>

191
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,621
but I stopped
because they kept getting stolen.

192
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,415
<i>So that's why that treasure box...</i>

193
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,125
<i>...Always had money in it.</i>

194
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,045
So, do you do your bartering around here?

195
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,924
I have customers on a lower floor,

196
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,343
but even if we go now,
they probably won't have time for us.

197
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,138
I didn't want to leave
the garden lying idle,

198
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,306
so I harvested the crops.

199
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,349
But you can throw them away
if you don't need them.

200
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,186
You can't do that!
You shouldn't waste food!

201
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,940
You worked so hard to cultivate them,
and they're so glossy and delicious!

202
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,275
You're growing attached to them.

203
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,947
Well, in that case,
we really should trade them around here.

204
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,075
-<i>Around here, huh?
-Around here, huh?</i>

205
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,954
<i>There are merchants
even inside the dungeon.</i>

206
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,335
Enter.

207
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,133
<i>Many of their customers are adventurers</i>

208
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,553
<i>or people who, for reasons,
can't go back above ground.</i>

209
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,309
Welcome, my dear guests.

210
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,895
Are you looking for a place to stay
or something to eat?

211
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,271
We want to trade.

212
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,856
Well, well.

213
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,943
So, what do you have?

214
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,319
Vegetables.

215
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,114
Go away, go away!

216
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,574
Wait, at least listen to...

217
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,952
{\an8}If you want to trade, bring coins!

218
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,704
{\an8}Do you understand? Coins!

219
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,581
{\an8}The round, shiny, and glittery things!

220
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,584
It's not like we want
to trade them for gems.

221
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,336
You have a kitchen here, don't you?

222
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,337
You need ingredients...

223
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,339
These are round and shiny, too.

224
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,342
Show this carrot to your cook.

225
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,718
I'm sure they'll want to use it.

226
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,429
Who would eat something so disgusting?!

227
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,807
How awful!

228
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,561
{\an8}You'll incur divine punishment
if you waste food!

229
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,189
Throw them out now!

230
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,191
{\an8}-Quickly now!
-Listen to...

231
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,069
Huh?

232
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,325
Orcs!

233
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,287
Kill the ones with weapons first!

234
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,330
Don't leave even one alive!

235
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,337
Why are orcs here?

236
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,715
I thought they were on much lower floors.

237
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,675
Anyway, we have to run...

238
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,723
-Marcille!
-Wait.

239
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,274
What are you doing here, Senshi?

240
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,028
That's what I want to ask as well.

241
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,074
Are these folks your acquaintances?

242
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,075
That's right.

243
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,871
To think you would associate
with humans and an elf.

244
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,165
By customers, did you mean...

245
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,917
I meant them.

246
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,464
I figured he meant folks like them,
but orcs, huh?

247
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,049
I thought they'd be goblins at least.

248
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,343
I assumed he meant Kobolds.

249
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,595
{\an8}The Red Dragon showed up.

250
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:35,267
<i>The Red Dragon
that rarely appeared in the past.</i>

251
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:40,230
{\an8}But lately, it's been showing up
near our settlement.

252
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,858
{\an8}There are some who can't fight
in our settlement.

253
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,237
{\an8}We came to this floor
for temporary refuge.

254
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,657
The Red Dragon, could it be?

255
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,784
The Dragon, where did you see it?

256
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:56,246
Are you asking me
to tell you where our settlement is?

257
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,164
I refuse.

258
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,917
Boss, we dealt with everyone inside.

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,960
Good.

260
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,170
Carry out everything that might be useful.

261
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,047
What on earth?

262
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,675
Rotten milk?

263
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,218
Throw it away.

264
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,179
Those are crops you cultivated, right?

265
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,557
As you can see, we're in need right now.

266
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,559
I'd like you to share that with me.

267
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,645
For barter?

268
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,021
In that case, these are...

269
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:21,939
No.

270
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,482
As I said,

271
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,527
we can't afford that right now.

272
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,990
It pains me to ask this of a friend,

273
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,451
but I want you to give us
all the stuff you have there.

274
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,621
S-Senshi.

275
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,707
Very well.

276
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,250
Good.

277
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,461
But in exchange,
I have a favor to ask you.

278
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,798
Tonight, let us stay at your place.

279
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,716
-Huh?
-Huh?

280
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,676
If you will grant us that,

281
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,762
we will gladly offer our lives
or our vegetables.

282
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,680
Huh?

283
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,140
And you there!

284
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,475
That isn't rotten, it's fermented!

285
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,310
Be sure to take it with you!

286
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,316
Why did you say that?

287
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,068
They took our weapons.

288
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,529
If we learn the location
of their campsite,

289
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,364
we'll never see the light of day again.

290
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,409
You do have a plan, right?

291
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,998
The jar I told an orc to take earlier

292
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,584
is leaven made of yeast.

293
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,839
And the orcs have the flour
that was in the kitchen.

294
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,007
In other words...

295
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,008
In other words?

296
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,844
I can make bread!

297
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,555
-Moron!
-So you don't have a plan!

298
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,099
-Moron!
-You just wanted to make bread!

299
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,309
Moron!

300
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,144
Hey, there! Be quiet!

301
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,690
It's an elf!

302
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,650
What a barbaric face.

303
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,819
Stay inside this cage.

304
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,155
Dad came back!

305
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,409
We better not end up
becoming their meal for today.

306
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,120
Where did you put the leaven?!

307
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,583
If you don't know how to use it,
you're sitting on a gold mine!

308
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,044
Give it to me! I'll make you bread!

309
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,922
Bread!

310
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,261
Mix together strong-wheat flour,
salt, sugar, leaven, and water.

311
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,681
And knead it until it comes together.

312
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,184
Are you playing with mud?

313
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,185
Huh?

314
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,563
How about a history lesson?

315
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,859
This is a story about a time
when we were still living above ground

316
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,569
instead of under the ground.

317
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,739
People like that elf and humans there

318
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,743
killed many of our people
and took our lands.

319
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,539
Orcs killed a lot of other races, too.

320
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,456
What?

321
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,458
Now, you add olive oil.

322
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,588
We were forced to leave the surface
and after wandering for a while,

323
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,968
we found our place underground,
and we had peace for a while.

324
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,804
Until they found us again.

325
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,975
Hold the edge of the dough
and knead it by punching it down.

326
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,937
They poured oil into the underground
and set fire to it.

327
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,650
That's because you orcs kept raiding
the villages of other races over and over!

328
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,820
It was the only way for us to survive.

329
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,198
That was your way of life
even before you moved underground.

330
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,741
That's why you were driven out!

331
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,494
Stop it, Marcille. That's enough...

332
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,288
Shut up, half-foot!

333
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,707
Knead it with more strength, will you?!

334
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,749
Sorry.

335
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,002
Give it to me! I'll do it!

336
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,462
We were driven from the surface
and fled underground.

337
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,590
And when we finally
arrived at the dungeon,

338
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,884
you folks tried to take it from us!

339
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,429
It was the villagers
above ground who found it first!

340
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,265
{\an8}But we went into the depths first!

341
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,059
{\an8}Then the zombies roaming around
were there before anyone else!

342
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,396
Once the dough stretches smoothly,
it's time for the first fermentation.

343
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,821
When the dough doubles in size,
divide it evenly and shape it neatly.

344
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,490
You've been silent
this whole time, tall-man.

345
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,076
But what are you thinking?

346
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,414
<i>They say anyone who defeats
the lunatic magician who built this place</i>

347
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,459
<i>will gain this whole castle.</i>

348
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,670
Why are you trying
to go to the depths of the dungeon?

349
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,550
{\an8}When you gain the kingdom,
what will you do?

350
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,932
I've heard of that story,
but I've never thought of that.

351
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,892
What a joke.

352
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,561
All adventures are like you.

353
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,689
You make your daily wage
and you test your skills.

354
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,942
You're all just greedy fools.

355
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,362
I shudder to think what might happen
if someone like you

356
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,072
ends up getting this castle.

357
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,743
{\an8}That's why we kill anyone
from the surface we can find.

358
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,370
What a poor excuse!

359
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,039
Then you should compete
for the throne as well.

360
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,792
Or is plundering
the only thing orcs can do?

361
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,294
At least you have spunk.

362
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,796
I like that.

363
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,465
{\an8}I'll throw you into the fire alive!

364
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,884
{\an8}See? You turn to violence so quickly!

365
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,636
Second fermentation.

366
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,392
Once it has expanded enough,

367
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,395
cook it on low heat one side at a time.

368
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,647
Let it steam a little,

369
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,899
and open the lid.

370
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,486
And the bread is done!

371
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,947
It smells so good!

372
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,615
Let's have a taste.

373
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,994
Stop! That bread is ours.

374
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,912
We won't give it to you.

375
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,913
What?

376
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,749
I let you make bread
because you wanted to,

377
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,711
but what we do with it is up to us.

378
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,839
Dad.

379
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,593
These people made it together,
but they don't get to eat it?

380
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,142
That's because bread alone
won't make a meal.

381
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:56,106
You need a main dish, meat, and vegetables
for a well-balanced meal.

382
00:21:56,189 --> 00:22:00,193
Your father just wanted us to wait
until the other dishes were ready.

383
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,611
Hey! What are you saying?!

384
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,906
Exactly. He promised
to provide lodging for a night

385
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,783
in exchange for our vegetables.

386
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,579
And your father is someone
who can't break promises.

387
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,211
Hey! Make them some random food!

388
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,219
FRESHLY PICKED STEWED CABBAGE

389
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,138
Here! It's ready!

390
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,348
-Eat!
-Okay.

391
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,433
Thank you.

392
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,692
I-It's good!

393
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,235
So spicy!

394
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,821
It's spicy and delicious!

395
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,741
It's made with the same ingredients
as Senshi's stewed cabbage,

396
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,993
but it's a completely different dish.

397
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,663
I said plundering
was the only thing you could do,

398
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,207
but orcs can be pretty decent, too.

399
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,167
Shut up.

400
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,377
Um...

401
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,256
You asked me why I was trying
to reach the depths of the dungeon.

402
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,301
You see, my sister
was eaten by the Red Dragon.

403
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,678
That's why I'm going after the Dragon.

404
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,892
If you will tell us where it is,
we'll defeat the Red Dragon.

405
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,270
We won't involve your settlement at all.

406
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,610
I promise.

407
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,826
Hey, bring me a map.

408
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,743
Got it.

409
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,830
It's two floors under this one.

410
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,332
Last time I saw it, it was around
the west residential area.

411
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,292
Thank you.

412
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,968
From now on,
I'll think about the possibility

413
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,137
of gaining this dungeon as I explore it.

414
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,099
It's tough to imagine a guy
who gets captured by an orc

415
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,976
and bakes bread will become a king.

416
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,396
{\an8}But good luck.

417
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,023
It tastes really good.

418
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,948
You know, that cabbage
was grown on the back of a Golem.

419
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,664
<i>Even though people have varying views,
they all experience hunger.</i>

420
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,172
<i>It may only be dungeon food,
but it's still dungeon food.</i>

421
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,930
