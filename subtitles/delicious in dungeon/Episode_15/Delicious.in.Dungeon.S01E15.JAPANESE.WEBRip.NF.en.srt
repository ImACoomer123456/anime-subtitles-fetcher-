1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,852
Dammit!

3
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,978
What the hell?

4
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,731
This wall wasn't here on our way down!

5
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,192
Another earthquake?

6
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,985
Not an earthquake.

7
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,613
The dungeon is shifting
and changing its layout.

8
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,616
It's probably that magician's doing.

9
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,369
Maybe he's on the lookout for us.

10
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,665
You mean he's been making us
wander around in circles this whole time?

11
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,376
Maybe it's worth taking a little risk.

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,128
Give me a minute.

13
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,887
It's gone now.

14
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,725
Climbing over walls
might not be a smart move.

15
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,228
Guess we'll have to pick our way out.

16
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,525
Anyway, is it just me...

17
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,820
or is the city starting to bustle?

18
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,822
With the Red Dragon dead,

19
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,032
the lurking monsters
are starting to show themselves.

20
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,785
This level was originally
crawling with monsters.

21
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,705
We're lucky we didn't
bump into any until now.

22
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,418
Hey, are you okay?

23
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,254
<i>This isn't good.</i>

24
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,631
<i>We've been trekking without a break,</i>

25
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,758
<i>and we haven't had
a decent meal since that Dragon.</i>

26
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,511
<i>How old is Laios?</i>

27
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>I'm not sure if he's getting up there
or still in his youth,</i>

28
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,518
<i>but Chilchuck and Marcille
are likely still growing.</i>

29
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,436
Come on.

30
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>It's downright shameful not being able
to provide them with proper meals.</i>

31
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,276
<i>I must feed them.</i>

32
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,278
<i>The youngsters must be fed.</i>

33
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,821
<i>I must feed them!</i>

34
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,366
What's that sweet smell?

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,076
Is it food?

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,579
No, it smells like flowers.

37
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,917
Where there are flowers,
there's usually water.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,418
Track it down for us, Chil!

39
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,628
On it!

40
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,509
Is this place a graveyard or something?

41
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,139
Wait, someone's there.

42
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,605
Don't look!

43
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,026
W-We beg your pardon.

44
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,903
Hey, Senshi! Let go of me!

45
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,531
Get back, Senshi!

46
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,038
What's this?

47
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,039
Draw your weapon!

48
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,291
These creatures aren't human.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,543
They're Dryad flowers!

50
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,004
Then what's this body fluid?

51
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,798
<i>It was not a liquid.</i>

52
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,301
<i>Tiny particles entered the body
through the respiratory system,</i>

53
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,928
<i>sticking to the mucous membrane.</i>

54
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,683
<i>The body recognized
these particles as poison</i>

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,604
<i>and kicked the immune system into gear,
immediately attempting to flush them out.</i>

56
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,064
<i>This is known as...</i>

57
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,443
<i>hay fever.</i>

58
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,570
Ugh, gross!

59
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,738
It hurts!

60
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,783
{\an8}It's the Dryads' pollen!

61
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,536
This is bad. Don't breathe it!

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,333
This isn't good.

63
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,210
I can't stop crying.

64
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,632
Get up!

65
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,134
Pull yourself together, Senshi!

66
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,219
Laios!

67
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,346
-Kensuke...
-Dammit!

68
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,348
My eyes are acting up too...

69
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,102
Senshi, reach out your hand!

70
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,564
On three, use it to strike behind you!

71
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:15,982
One,

72
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,650
two...

73
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,569
Three!

74
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,911
Damn, my eyes are starting to itch too.

75
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,246
I can't see.

76
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,714
Run, Senshi!

77
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,631
No!

78
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,760
It is my duty to protect the youngsters!

79
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,136
Are you serious?

80
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,054
Chilchuck!

81
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,264
Be my eyes!

82
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,600
I can't. I can't see anything!

83
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,935
You have sharper senses!

84
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,646
<i>Smell?</i>

85
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,150
<i>No, the smell of pollen
is too overpowering.</i>

86
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,568
<i>Hearing?</i>

87
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,780
<i>Senshi's sneezing too loud.</i>

88
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,033
<i>I can't rely on my sight,
smell, or hearing.</i>

89
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,994
<i>The wind!</i>

90
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,332
{\an8}It avoided your sneeze
and retreated diagonally to the right.

91
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,375
Senshi, swing up now!

92
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,843
Kensuke...

93
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,223
<i>My staff is completely broken in half.</i>

94
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,976
<i>I've got to mend it and infuse it
with magic quickly before it withers away.</i>

95
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,772
<i>It took me years to nurture it
to its current state...</i>

96
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,736
I-It's safe in there.

97
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,862
Don't lie!

98
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,491
You fought against Dryad flowers?

99
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,576
That must've been tough.

100
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,745
I didn't think they were flower monsters.

101
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,998
I totally thought they were
male and female humans.

102
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,126
Dryads are unisexual flowers,

103
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,086
so you're right about them
being male and female.

104
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,255
Just maybe...

105
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,881
{\an8}What will you do about him?

106
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,259
{\an8}Shouldn't we stop him by force?

107
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:10,346
{\an8}But we can't afford to be picky anymore.

108
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,642
{\an8}At this point, does it really matter
if the flower resembles a human?

109
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,060
Marci...

110
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,522
I found some!

111
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,858
Dryad fruits!

112
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,861
How to turn back time...

113
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,780
Stop hunting for shady magic
like it's no big deal!

114
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,200
Your black magic jokes aren't funny!

115
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:36,289
The last Dryad I took out
didn't release any pollen.

116
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,124
{\an8}It must've been a female flower.

117
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,462
{\an8}Flowers before pollination
care for and protect their fruits.

118
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,756
I found some more
fruit-like things over here.

119
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,759
Those are buds.

120
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,262
They'll eventually grow
into Dryad flowers.

121
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,765
These seem easier
to eat than those fruits.

122
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,809
They might be pretty tasty.

123
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,227
Let's harvest them.

124
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,024
Don't pick too many.

125
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,235
Okay.

126
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,322
There are Mandrakes here.

127
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,282
We don't have time to get a dog,

128
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,242
so I'll just chop its head off
if you don't mind.

129
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,579
Shut up. When are you going
to let me live that down?

130
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,417
It's a pretty decent harvest.

131
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,545
Good thing I borrowed
an axe from the orcs!

132
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:30,593
<i>Put the chopped ingredients
into a pot with water and let it stew.</i>

133
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,846
<i>When the ingredients are soft,
remove from heat</i>

134
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,098
<i>and mash them inside the pot.</i>

135
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:41,354
<i>Once they turn into a paste,
add more water and seasoning.</i>

136
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,153
Smells delightful.

137
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,363
I have an idea.

138
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,450
<i>Sauté them lightly with butter
and throw in some mushrooms.</i>

139
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,371
<i>Pour melted cheese on top,</i>

140
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,622
<i>and it's done!</i>

141
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,375
JACK-O'-LANTERN POTAGE AND
SAUTÉED DRYAD BUDS WITH CHEESE

142
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,669
Did you have to put the soup in that?

143
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,880
I thought it might aid
in restoring your magic a little.

144
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,259
Don't think you can excuse it
just because you meant well.

145
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,094
I'll try it, though.

146
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,471
<i>It's sweet!</i>

147
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,223
<i>It has a light floral fragrance.</i>

148
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,475
<i>It's rich and creamy,
but melts in your mouth.</i>

149
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,435
<i>I love this.</i>

150
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,105
What an appalling sight.

151
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,320
The sourness of the cheese
pairs nicely with this.

152
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,990
I like the bitter tang the buds have.

153
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,286
Anyway, how do we
even get out of this dungeon?

154
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,538
What if we never find our way out?

155
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,125
{\an8}If all the routes
to the surface are blocked,

156
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,003
{\an8}it would disrupt the flow of magic,
so that's unlikely.

157
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,630
There has to be a way out somewhere.

158
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,843
Are there any patterns
to the shifts in the dungeon?

159
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,177
There must be!

160
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,680
Let's note down the timings
and locations of the rumblings.

161
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,724
I'm starting to feel hopeful.

162
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,019
A full stomach does wonders
for optimism, doesn't it?

163
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,734
I'm starting to feel warmer.

164
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,069
I think some of my magic is returning.

165
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,406
Laios and Senshi,
I need to heal your injuries.

166
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,199
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

167
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,409
I won't.

168
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,871
Laios, you'll be the one doing the work.

169
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,207
I'll teach you some magic.

170
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,462
I can't protect all of you
from the lunatic magician by myself.

171
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,299
If you can use healing and defense magic,
it would help a lot.

172
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,344
Falin has taught you the basics, right?

173
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,845
Sort of.

174
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,598
She specializes in the gnome magic system,

175
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,851
{\an8}which is a bit different
from the one I use.

176
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,896
But the fundamentals are similar,
so you'll catch on.

177
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,231
{\an8}I'll drum it into you in no time.

178
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,986
We need to become stronger.

179
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,533
Those two are too optimistic.

180
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,912
When you're young, that's just right.

181
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,083
Would you stop treating me like a child?

182
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,501
It's embarrassing!

183
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,754
{\an8}Why did you cover my eyes
in front of the monsters anyway?

184
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,422
It helped in hindsight, but still!

185
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,009
Well, Chilchuck...

186
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,596
You mentioned your father had passed away.

187
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,932
What about it?

188
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:23,891
I see.

189
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,062
This seems like a good opportunity,
so I'll teach you something.

190
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,815
Take a seat.

191
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,777
You're probably getting to that age
where you're starting to get curious,

192
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,197
but it's important
to have the correct information.

193
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,032
What's this about?

194
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,742
You see, humans

195
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,661
also have stamens and pistils.

196
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,039
That's not it! Again!

197
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,791
Pay attention!

198
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,337
<i>And so, they passed the night away.</i>

199
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,258
Come on. Hurry.

200
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,640
Not like that!

201
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,436
I didn't want to touch you in a weird way.

202
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,521
Don't let stuff like that bother you!

203
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,231
{\an8}Give me your left hand.

204
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,902
See? Just like this.

205
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,990
Feeling embarrassed won't help you
improve your magic skills.

206
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,783
Now focus!

207
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,204
Be mindful of the magic
coursing through your body,

208
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,831
like blood through your veins.

209
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,292
Let it flow through
the palms of your hands,

210
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,504
from the top of your head
to the tips of my toes.

211
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,383
Sync your breathing,
temperature, and pulse with mine.

212
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,429
Once you're ready, repeat after me.

213
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,556
{\an8}<i>-Sperae...
-Sperae...</i>

214
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,558
{\an8}<i>-Yeptum...
-Yeptum...</i>

215
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,685
{\an8}<i>-Rufermus...
-Rufermus...</i>

216
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,145
{\an8}<i>-Vilal...
-Vilal...</i>

217
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,397
<i>-Eurekant...
-Eurekant...</i>

218
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,399
<i>-Oonzu...
-Oonzu...</i>

219
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,151
That's itchy!

220
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,613
It's itching like crazy!

221
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,864
A-Are you okay?

222
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,533
My scab came off.

223
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,952
It worked!

224
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,120
You did it, Laios!

225
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,330
{\an8}Really?

226
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,207
{\an8}You're bleeding, though.

227
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,459
This is normal for your first try.

228
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,586
But you're a fast learner.

229
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,047
Maybe you really do
come from a talented line!

230
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,717
The way you explained things
made it easy to understand.

231
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,469
Thanks.

232
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,972
Well then, before you forget this feeling,

233
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,390
let's try healing Senshi.

234
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,686
I'll be watching,
so repeat what you did just now.

235
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,732
<i>Now, it's a temporary fix,</i>

236
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,609
<i>but I'll use Dryad twigs
to repair my staff.</i>

237
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,027
<i>I hope it attaches.</i>

238
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,534
-That felt weird.
-S-Sorry!

239
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,619
Like I said,
don't let stuff like that bother you!

240
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,621
Don't be embarrassed.

241
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,998
Feeling shy
is the biggest obstacle to progress!

242
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,460
Actually, you shouldn't
underestimate things like that.

243
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,881
Healers interact a lot with people,
which can cause difficulties.

244
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,510
The main reason parties break up
is often due to relationship issues.

245
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,888
Falling in and out of love,
envy, jealousy,

246
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,390
grudges and hatred.

247
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,058
They can be a real hassle.

248
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,812
Are you talking about Falin and Shuro?

249
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,855
I'm just speaking from my own experiences.

250
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,277
A leader needs the ability
to unite people more than combat skills.

251
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,905
To be honest, I want Laios
to focus on developing his social skills

252
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,157
and his ability to read people
more than magic.

253
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,078
If he had done so, he wouldn't have
unknowingly ended up

254
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,621
being an accomplice in black magic.

255
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,126
Well, Chilchuck, why don't you
learn a bit about magic yourself?

256
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,003
Maybe your ignorance is making you afraid.

257
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,005
Well, sorry about that!

258
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,758
Many of my kin got kidnapped by elves
and never came back,

259
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,803
just because they were involved
with some black magic artifact.

260
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,431
That's why I never got the chance
to learn more about magic.

261
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,099
So forgive me if I'm ignorant.

262
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,811
To sum up the ancient magic I'm studying,

263
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,190
it draws energy from another dimension
where infinity exists.

264
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,736
<i>How do you turn a cup of water into vapor?</i>

265
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,529
<i>By bringing it to a boil.</i>

266
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,950
<i>Well then, how do you
vaporize an entire lake?</i>

267
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,785
The theory is the same,

268
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,829
but actually doing it is a bit tricky.

269
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,584
<i>This magic would require
an enormous amount of power and time.</i>

270
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,336
<i>So, you reinforce it
with coordinate magic.</i>

271
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,131
This dungeon is connected
to the other dimension at multiple points.

272
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,552
It's through this power that monsters
are summoned and this dungeon is formed.

273
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:33,682
{\an8}Earlier, Falin no longer
had the strength to revive herself.

274
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,603
<i>So I rewrote a section of the dungeon</i>

275
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,106
<i>to make her body a part of the dungeon.</i>

276
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,359
Only for a brief moment, of course.

277
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,237
Another rumbling.

278
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,238
It's close.

279
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,991
Look over there!

280
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,326
The wall is crumbling.

281
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,245
Where are the bricks going?

282
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,039
How about we take a closer look?

283
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,125
Huh?

284
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,670
What's wrong?

285
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,630
I-I suddenly feel dizzy.

286
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:10,386
You might be experiencing mana sickness
because you used magic for the first time.

287
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,888
It should pass soon.

288
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,014
We're leaving you behind.

289
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,474
Stay put, okay?

290
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,145
<i>Whether my eyes are shut or open,
all I see are lurid colors.</i>

291
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,481
<i>Help.</i>

292
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,233
<i>Let me die.</i>

293
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,901
<i>The magician...</i>

294
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,321
<i>Am I hallucinating? Am I hearing things?</i>

295
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,616
<i>Please, let me die.</i>

296
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,869
<i>Mana sickness sucks.</i>

297
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,375
The path is shifting.

298
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,005
It feels like we're starting to grasp
a pattern, but then again, not quite.

299
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,009
We'll need to observe for a little longer.

300
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,845
It's frustrating that we can't
make much progress, but...

301
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,598
The platform is rising!

302
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,891
Get off!

303
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,393
Ow!

304
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,020
{\an8}That was close.

305
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,647
We almost lost our way back.

306
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,486
<i>Carrier of a cruel, petrifying venom,</i>

307
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,821
<i>the Cockatrice.</i>

308
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,994
It's like a Basilisk!

309
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,246
But a Cockatrice is much worse!

310
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,581
Never let it bite you!

311
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,999
You'll be turned to stone!

312
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,168
There's a door on the left!

313
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,711
Let's get in there!

314
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,600
What's our plan now?

315
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,435
This door won't hold for very long.

316
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,604
Can we sneak out through the back?

317
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,066
If this thing is anything like a Basilisk,

318
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,027
it should sense us by our body heat.

319
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,738
It will be tricky to give it the slip.

320
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,366
But that's the ability of the serpent.

321
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,161
The rooster head
should rely on its vision.

322
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:04,249
Marcille, do you remember how
Laios took down the Basilisk last time?

323
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,422
<i>Don't let it frighten you!</i>

324
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,467
<i>Intimidate the Cockatrice
with all your heart and soul!</i>

325
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,553
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

326
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:21,058
<i>Make yourself look big
and shout at the top of your lungs!</i>

327
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,436
<i>Sure, I might be the tallest of the three,</i>

328
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,314
<i>but that Cockatrice
is twice as big as the Basilisk.</i>

329
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,692
<i>And I'm not confident
about shouting either.</i>

330
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,529
<i>Wait, how did Laios shout again?</i>

331
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,573
<i>Was it like a yell?</i>

332
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,325
<i>Or more like a roar?</i>

333
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,249
<i>Never mind. If I can frighten it,
that's all that matters!</i>

334
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,131
<i>The end.</i>

335
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,590
<i>This won't work.</i>

336
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,676
<i>I just know I'll fail!</i>

337
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,553
<i>There's no way I can do what Laios did.</i>

338
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,596
<i>So what do I do?</i>

339
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,642
<i>I'll have to do it</i>

340
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,811
<i>my own way!</i>

341
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,234
<i>The most brilliant female student
in the school's history,</i>

342
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,569
<i>Marcille!</i>

343
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,906
What was that explosion just now?

344
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,700
It's Marcille! Let's go!

345
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,624
Too shallow.

346
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,628
<i>Oh no. I drew too much
attention to myself.</i>

347
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,797
<i>Now both heads are focused on me.</i>

348
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,133
<i>I don't have time
to finish an incantation.</i>

349
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,146
Marcille! Did it bite you?

350
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,939
I'm okay.

351
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,860
It bit you, you idiot!

352
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,528
For crying out loud!

353
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,031
What? You got bitten by a Cockatrice?

354
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,240
This is bad.

355
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,118
Do you know what to do
when you're bitten by a Cockatrice?

356
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,162
There's a procedure for that?

357
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,997
First, take off your pants.

358
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,959
Sit with your legs tightly closed.

359
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,172
Keep your arms to your sides
and cover your ears with your hands.

360
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,548
Close your mouth too.

361
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,802
Perfect.

362
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,096
Now you're all set
to turn into stone at any moment.

363
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,807
I thought the procedure
was supposed to prevent that!

364
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,274
She got petrified
in an awfully precarious position.

365
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,359
Something might break.

366
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,445
Her center of gravity is off,
so she might topple any second.

367
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,155
This is bad.

368
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,617
Being turned to stone
is the last thing a human could want.

369
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,452
What are we going to do?

370
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,954
Is there a way to reverse it?

371
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,456
There are a couple of ways.

372
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,708
First, we could wait
for her to heal naturally.

373
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,462
Apparently, petrification is more
of a curse than the effects of a poison.

374
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,173
Elves have strong resistance to spells,

375
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,300
so she should recover faster
compared to other races.

376
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:05,138
Next, we can try finding
other adventurers who might have herbs

377
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,599
or know-how to reverse petrification.

378
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:12,104
{\an8}Lastly, I could give it a shot
with a healing spell.

379
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,522
You?

380
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,608
Marcille taught me how
to read the book of magic.

381
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,611
There should be a spell in there
to reverse petrification.

382
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,865
Let's keep an eye out
for herbs and other adventurers,

383
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,410
while also giving
the other two options a try.

384
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,621
How long will it take for her to heal?

385
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,833
It takes anywhere from six months
to ten years for a tall-man.

386
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,335
I'll go fetch the Cockatrice.

387
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,716
<i>They got pretty discolored in one night.</i>

388
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>I need to process them quickly.</i>

389
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,345
She looks like she's about to fall over.

390
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,640
Shouldn't we put something under her?

391
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,017
You're right.

392
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,852
I've got a good idea.

393
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:57,149
<i>Mix the julienned buds with seasoning
and place them in a pot.</i>

394
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,109
<i>Then, put Marcille on top.</i>

395
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,903
Oops, her eyelashes broke off.

396
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,740
<i>Soak the Cockatrice meat in salt water,</i>

397
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,368
<i>place it on Marcille's lap,
and let it rest.</i>

398
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,248
I suppose her position is more stable now.

399
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,250
She shouldn't topple over anymore.

400
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,878
She looks like some idol
from a pagan religion.

401
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,465
<i>After that, Laios
and his team worked hard.</i>

402
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,382
DAY 2

403
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,301
<i>They continued with trial and error.</i>

404
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,218
DAY 3

405
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,013
<i>And on the fourth day...</i>

406
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,014
{\an8}Found one!

407
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,016
How do you use it?

408
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,394
Why don't we try

409
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,021
placing it on her?

410
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,107
<i>The stone is starting
to warm with my body heat.</i>

411
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,776
<i>Let's try the spell.</i>

412
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,278
<i>Sperae Yeptum</i>

413
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,781
<i>Rufermus Vilal...</i>

414
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,868
<i>Am I pronouncing it correctly?</i>

415
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,871
Watch out!

416
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,670
Marcille!

417
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,797
You're soft again.

418
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,632
It worked!

419
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,841
Huh?

420
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,884
What's going on?

421
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,886
Why do I have vegetable slices on me?

422
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,346
And what's with this pot?

423
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,181
Let's see.

424
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,767
This worked too.

425
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,102
-Hurray!
-Will someone explain?

426
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,854
<i>Boil the brined meat</i>

427
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,606
<i>and cut it into thin slices.</i>

428
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,859
<i>Dress it with fermented buds,</i>

429
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,486
<i>and it's done.</i>

430
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,863
EISBEIN-STYLE COCKATRICE
AND SAUERKRAUT-STYLE DRYAD BUDS

431
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,615
It's been that long?

432
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,076
In the end, what did the trick?

433
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,079
We tried so many things,
who can say for sure?

434
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,331
I hope it was my spell.

435
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,626
Nah, I say it was
the fresh herbs that did it.

436
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:44,631
Maybe the cooked Cockatrice meat
neutralized the curse.

437
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:48,176
{\an8}<i>We need to get back
to the surface as soon as possible,</i>

438
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,678
{\an8}<i>and yet I delayed us all.</i>

439
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,388
{\an8}You guys, I'm sor...

440
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,099
{\an8}<i>No, that's not it.</i>

441
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,769
{\an8}<i>There's something else
I should say in this situation.</i>

442
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,313
{\an8}<i>Yes, first, I should say...</i>

443
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,192
You shouldn't use someone
as a fermentation weight.

444
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,320
<i>Be that as it may, dungeon food.</i>

445
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,614
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

446
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,873
