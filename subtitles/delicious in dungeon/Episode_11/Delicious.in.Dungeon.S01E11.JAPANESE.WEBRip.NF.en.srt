1
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,895
<i>I'm ready now.</i>

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,898
<i>I can bring down this building anytime.</i>

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,653
<i>I still have a lot of magic left.</i>

4
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,282
<i>At this rate, I can step in for Laios
and the others if anything happens.</i>

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,077
<i>This plan is good, right?</i>

6
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>I use up all my magic to stun the dragon.</i>

7
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,917
<i>Instead of using chancy explosive spells
against the dragon</i>

8
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>at the risk of everyone's lives,</i>

9
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,756
<i>it's more reliable to bury the dragon
in the debris of a building.</i>

10
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,675
<i>Yes, this is definitely a better plan.</i>

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,219
<i>Stay calm.</i>

12
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,434
<i>I need to focus on my task.</i>

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,520
<i>We'll make this work!</i>

14
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,315
<i>Hang in there, Falin!</i>

15
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,903
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

16
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,017
It noticed us.

17
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,143
Run!

18
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,274
It's so fast!

19
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,569
Just so you know, a Red Dragon's
maximum speed is 60 kilometers per hour!

20
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,904
You should've said that earlier!

21
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,239
The terrain is slowing it down!
It's all good!

22
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,575
Turn right at the next corner!

23
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,876
We'll lure it to unleash its fire breath
on this straight path.

24
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,295
<i>Dragons breathe fire</i>

25
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>by clicking their tongues
to ignite the fuel stored in their bodies.</i>

26
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>To prevent it from lashing out
when we restrain it,</i>

27
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,053
<i>we'll make it use up
all its fuel along the way!</i>

28
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,306
It's clicking its tongue!

29
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,266
Here comes!

30
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,897
<i>What intense heat!</i>

31
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,065
<i>But...</i>

32
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,573
<i>Thanks to this pot and magic,
we can endure it.</i>

33
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>Good. So far, so...</i>

34
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,246
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

35
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:11,292
<i>The heat of the pot
is spreading evenly and...</i>

36
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,294
So hot!

37
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,098
But of course, it's hot!

38
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,017
{\an8}Senshi uses it for cooking every day!

39
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,853
Somehow, I thought it would have
a special resistance to dragon fire.

40
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,063
I thought Namari said

41
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,858
that adamant protects
against all dragon attacks.

42
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,194
{\an8}She was just talking out of her hat!

43
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,487
I never said that.

44
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,950
Ugh, it's doing it again!

45
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,034
We have no choice!

46
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,411
We'll change our route!

47
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,377
Huh?

48
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,962
No way!

49
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,463
They're here already?

50
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,965
Aren't they a bit early?

51
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,467
Wait, what?

52
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,095
I thought the plan was to split in two!

53
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,848
Can I go ahead and stick to the plan?

54
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,808
{\an8}Ugh, I don't understand!

55
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,977
Fine! Here goes!

56
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,404
No way!

57
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,781
It's not hurt at all!

58
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,200
Shh!

59
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,118
Don't move.

60
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,047
<i>Its inverse scale is right there.</i>

61
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,342
<i>A few more steps, and I could reach it!</i>

62
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,394
<i>It...</i>

63
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,439
<i>It ran away!</i>

64
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,857
<i>Damn it, Kensuke!</i>

65
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,109
<i>Never trust a monster...</i>

66
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,487
-You...
-Laios! Chilchuck! Get up!

67
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,405
Above us!

68
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,825
Hide under its belly!

69
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,201
Laios, you bastard!

70
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,078
My bad! I'm sorry!

71
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,037
Dammit!

72
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,498
The common language
doesn't have enough words of insult!

73
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,958
<i>Ponza! Toroldo!</i>

74
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,586
-<i>Unerma! Poojam! Varo! Monsanto! Belcher!</i>
-I'm being insulted in a strange language!

75
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,463
What are we gonna do now?

76
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,591
It's angry! It's super angry!

77
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,759
{\an8}We have no choice.

78
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,594
{\an8}Let's run from the side of its tail...

79
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,766
{\an8}No, it's too dangerous.

80
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,436
{\an8}What if we never manage to escape
from under its crotch?

81
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,023
This won't do!

82
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,109
A simple incantation
won't have any effect on it.

83
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,193
Focus!

84
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,371
What did you do that for?!

85
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,998
Our only weapon just got shattered!

86
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,500
What do we do now?!

87
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,335
We have no choice.

88
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,545
Use this.

89
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:43,963
{\an8}What?

90
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,258
{\an8}Is that really made of a special metal?

91
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,303
<i>It slices through the bone
and skin of every monster.</i>

92
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,222
<i>And I've diligently
taken care of it each day.</i>

93
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,266
<i>There's probably
no other like it on this earth.</i>

94
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,768
It's a mithril cooking knife!

95
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,604
Mithril?

96
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,771
Are you serious?

97
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,357
{\an8}I wish Namari could've seen this.

98
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,110
{\an8}Depending on the situation,
she might've killed Senshi.

99
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,447
{\an8}I had a suspicion that she might,
which is why I chose to remain silent.

100
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,784
Take this!

101
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,914
It really pierced through its scale!

102
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,794
<i>But the blade is so short that no matter
where I strike,</i>

103
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,923
<i>I might not be able
to deliver a fatal blow.</i>

104
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,059
What should I do now?

105
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,436
This means the plan failed, right?

106
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,022
Or are they executing
a different strategy?

107
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,191
What am I supposed to do?

108
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,695
No time to hesitate!

109
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,697
Get back!

110
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,284
<i>My sword
is getting farther and farther away.</i>

111
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,704
{\an8}If we continue retreating,
we'll end up in the open square.

112
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,207
Then, we'll be turned to cinder
by its fire breath!

113
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,709
I will draw its attention.

114
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,336
Don't! It's too risky!

115
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,464
Laios, you understand, don't you?

116
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,926
Among all the monsters
you've eaten so far,

117
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,470
was there one
that didn't give their utmost effort?

118
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,431
In this place,
it's a matter of eat or be eaten.

119
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,726
If we don't make desperate efforts,
we'll be the ones who'll be eaten.

120
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,436
Brace yourself for the worst!

121
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,730
Senshi!

122
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,868
-Sen...
-Idiot!

123
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,246
There's no point if you rush out!

124
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,123
Retreat for now.

125
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,125
Figure something out with Marcille!

126
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,127
Hey! Are you still alive?

127
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,628
{\an8}I'll help you out now...

128
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,592
Can you move?

129
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,564
<i>I did it!</i>

130
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,863
It's stuck to the ground.

131
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,031
Move aside!

132
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,493
Laios!

133
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,290
I'll be right back!

134
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,752
Senshi! Get up!

135
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,587
Sen...

136
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,308
Sorry, Marcille.

137
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,060
I didn't expect to find you here.

138
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,646
I'm glad my magic seems to be working.

139
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,774
What's going on? Where are the other two?

140
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,108
Things aren't looking good.

141
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,444
Every strategy we came up with has failed.

142
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,322
The other two are unconscious
at the dragon's feet.

143
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,824
What?! W-What do we do?!

144
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,786
Right, the only option is to use my magic.

145
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,205
The dragon is injured and agitated.

146
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,540
It's risky to approach it
or enter its line of sight.

147
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,959
But we have to do something quickly!

148
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,128
-Let's head upstairs.
-What?

149
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,255
W-What will you do?

150
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,216
I'll climb to the height
of the dragon's head.

151
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,218
-And stand inside the pot.
-What?

152
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,929
Then, I want you to blow it up.

153
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,973
What? Seriously?

154
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,476
<i>The dragon is blind in its left eye.</i>

155
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,103
<i>If I approach from its left side,</i>

156
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,939
I should be able to leap onto it
without being noticed.

157
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,108
But...

158
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,027
<i>You did a similar maneuver before...</i>

159
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,822
<i>when you fought the Undine.</i>

160
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,534
But that was on the water with Water-Walk.

161
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,078
This time,
we have defense magic and the pot.

162
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,454
What happens next?

163
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,416
How will you stab its inverse scale
while clinging to its head?

164
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,335
I have an idea about that.

165
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,630
There's no room for more failures.

166
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,758
I don't plan on failing.

167
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,014
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

168
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,016
<i>You do have a plan, right?</i>

169
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,935
<i>I believe in you.</i>

170
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,717
<i>I'll be flung off.</i>

171
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,719
<i>I need to execute my plan swiftly.</i>

172
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,971
<i>It'll be over in an instant.</i>

173
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,348
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

174
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,059
<i>Especially when compared...</i>

175
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,729
<i>to Falin's pain!</i>

176
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,983
Laios!

177
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,758
Laios!

178
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,219
Where are you going?

179
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,721
I heard there's a ghost at the graveyard.

180
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,473
Don't tell Dad or anyone else, okay?

181
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,560
-Whoopee!
-Whoopee!

182
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,233
Don't worry.

183
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,569
It's difficult to walk
with you clinging to me like that.

184
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,493
There's not even a single bug.

185
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,911
Let's head back, Falin.

186
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,665
Laios...

187
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,341
Laios!

188
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,055
<i>Take it off!</i>

189
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,558
<i>Help me.</i>

190
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,810
-<i>Please. Take it off.
-It's cold.</i>

191
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,479
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

192
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,816
Falin, run...

193
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,653
Laios!

194
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,661
Let my brother...

195
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,456
go!

196
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,179
It's someone who was buried in that grave.

197
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,599
His ring is binding his soul.

198
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,351
Remove it for him.

199
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,812
And his soul will be set free.

200
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,648
A ring?

201
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,691
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,487
This is the grave of Olman,
who passed away recently.

203
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,866
When he was alive, he used to boast
about a golden ring he bought from an elf.

204
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,911
How did that child know about it?

205
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,708
Did I do something wrong?

206
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,252
You're incredible, Falin.

207
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,630
You have a knack for ghost magic.

208
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,840
Don't let it bother you.

209
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,009
Grown-ups are just scared of magic.

210
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,388
You should study proper magic.

211
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,098
You'll never be out of a job.

212
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,557
What kind of job?

213
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,558
Let's see.

214
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,061
You could become a priest
or a grave keeper.

215
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,563
Being a traveling exorcist
might be interesting, too.

216
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,653
You travel to foreign countries,
helping people in need.

217
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,488
That sounds fun.

218
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,074
If I do that, will you come with me?

219
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,283
Of course!

220
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,827
What country do you want to visit?

221
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,831
{\an8}I'd love to see the sea.

222
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,874
Or even a desert.

223
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,627
They say there's a country
of talking dogs in the desert.

224
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,296
{\an8}I definitely want to go there!

225
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,549
-<i>But...
-But...</i>

226
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,428
<i>maybe we shouldn't
travel together anymore.</i>

227
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,431
<i>Falin, why not?</i>

228
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,392
<i>You don't have to worry about me.</i>

229
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,855
<i>Goodbye, Laios.</i>

230
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,776
Laios, are you okay?

231
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,446
I stopped the bleeding for now.

232
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,905
Just hold on a bit longer.

233
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,867
I'll go look for the other two
and for your leg!

234
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,830
<i>"Don't worry about me"?</i>

235
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,375
<i>Don't say sad stuff like that.</i>

236
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,212
<i>I promise to bring you back.</i>

237
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,548
Hey!

238
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,009
Chilchuck!

239
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,844
Senshi!

240
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,722
There you are!

241
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,515
Thank goodness!

242
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,933
Are you okay?

243
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,060
Of course, not.

244
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,564
I need to work on my defense magic more.

245
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,193
At least we haven't suffered any ruptures,
so that's good enough.

246
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:55,199
{\an8}<i>Tronsum Lunaae Stantinus Eurekant Oonzu.</i>

247
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,702
Ow!

248
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,497
Isn't he in more pain now?

249
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,958
When a serious injury is healed quickly,
you experience recovery pain.

250
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,335
Don't worry!

251
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,170
It's a sign that you've healed properly!

252
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,505
It's your turn, Senshi.

253
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,257
I'm fine. I'll heal on my own.

254
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,801
It could take months.

255
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,386
Falin was skilled at recovery magic,

256
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,181
but I'm pretty confident
in my speed as well.

257
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,226
T-That's the cause of the pain, isn't it?

258
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,936
GAAAAAAH

259
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,229
SNAP POP

260
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,231
Laios!

261
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,066
Come on, lift your leg.

262
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:40,577
<i>Britrayeums Lunae Actum
Asbam Histum Eres Eurekant Ounzu.</i>

263
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,499
It reattached!

264
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,753
The inside of my leg feels itchy.

265
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,755
It's recovery pain.

266
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,258
Well done, Laios.

267
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,511
You really defeated the Red Dragon.

268
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,388
It's thanks to all of you.

269
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,015
If any one of you weren't here,
we couldn't have won.

270
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,768
{\an8}For a moment,
I was afraid of what might happen.

271
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,187
Even my blood froze.

272
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,273
Our estimate was a little too naive.

273
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,234
{\an8}Well, we won, so that's all that matters.

274
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,027
{\an8}But...

275
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,779
Here, Laios.

276
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,864
Kensuke.

277
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,033
{\an8}I still haven't forgiven you for this yet.

278
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,744
You owe me a long explanation.

279
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,662
Right.

280
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,292
Well then, let's look inside its stomach.

281
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,928
What a thick skin.

282
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,513
Fighting with this cooking knife,

283
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,640
no wonder we couldn't even reach
its subcutaneous fat.

284
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,477
But it's going to be a lot of work
getting to its stomach.

285
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,438
I could try blasting it open.

286
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,941
The insides of a dragon
are no different from any other creature.

287
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,569
Let's slowly carve through its flesh.

288
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,621
It's one of its ribs.

289
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,956
Let's go around it and keep digging.

290
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,295
It's dark. Should we light a lantern?

291
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,588
No fire.

292
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,256
Marcille, light.

293
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,352
It's so hot.

294
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,480
It reminds me
of when I used to work in a mine.

295
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,733
What's this?

296
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,318
{\an8}It's the stomach!

297
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,739
All right.

298
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,241
Let's open it.

299
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,502
It's empty.

300
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,712
It can't be...

301
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,006
Maybe we got the wrong dragon.

302
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,383
That's impossible.

303
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,011
The scar above its eye
confirms it's the same dragon.

304
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,434
It's difficult to imagine there being
multiple territorial males in one area.

305
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,187
Let's examine its intestines as well.

306
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,984
{\an8}N-Not even a fragment of a bone is left.

307
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,195
We have to examine its droppings, too!

308
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,741
{\an8}Could its digestion have been sped up
by constant movement without sleep?

309
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,621
I got it!

310
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,934
What is this?

311
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,437
{\an8}A mass of hair and bone.

312
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,647
Some creatures
that ingest their prey whole

313
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,025
tend to regurgitate indigestible parts.

314
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,696
But instead of doing that, Red Dragons
use them as fuel for their fire breath.

315
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,783
These black hairs suggest
it consumed a few Wargs.

316
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,951
And...

317
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,457
H-Hair...

318
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,833
Could it be...

319
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,209
Let's sift through the mass.

320
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,628
We might find human bones in it.

321
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,593
Hey, isn't this staff...

322
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,804
Hey, Laios!

323
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,056
This staff!

324
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,020
F...

325
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,856
Falin?
