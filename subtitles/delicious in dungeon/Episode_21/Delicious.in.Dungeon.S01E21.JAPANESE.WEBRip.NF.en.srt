1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,523
We're back!

3
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,276
-Nothing beats the air above ground.
-Here you go.

4
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,529
Is it morning or evening?

5
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,905
Don't touch the window yet!

6
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,032
You'll disrupt the teleportation spell!

7
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:56,950
Kabru.

8
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,702
Tomorrow, I'm going to report
to the Lord of the Island.

9
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,413
I want you to back up my story.

10
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,208
Are you going
to share everything with him?

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,419
There's no need to bring up
Laios and his party specifically.

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,299
I just don't want Falin
to take any more lives.

13
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,425
All right.

14
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,803
You should get some good rest today.

15
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,013
Check it out, Kuro!

16
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,181
Huge ship.

17
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,226
I wonder if it's packed with rich folks!

18
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,315
This is bad.

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,526
Toshiro,

20
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,028
I think we should head out right now.

21
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,446
What's this white ship?

22
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,074
It's a ship of the western elves.

23
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,326
See that figurehead of a little bird?

24
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,662
They're known as the Canaries.

25
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,584
<i>They show up when a dungeon's
danger level rises past a certain point.</i>

26
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,297
<i>Their mission is to investigate dungeons
and take control of them.</i>

27
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,634
Word had it they were applying pressure
on the Lord of the Island,

28
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,970
but it looks like they're
really cracking down now.

29
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,847
Is that even permitted?

30
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,932
This land belongs to tall-men.

31
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,145
Short-lived races are like infants
to elves and dwarves.

32
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,107
And the Lord of the Island
isn't skilled at negotiations.

33
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>We should hurry.</i>

34
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,447
Hey!

35
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,782
It's you, Shuro.

36
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,075
Namari.

37
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,827
Where's Falin?

38
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,499
Laios and the others
haven't given up yet, though.

39
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,251
I see.

40
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,172
{\an8}Were they eating "you know what"?

41
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,298
{\an8}They were.

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,509
We've come to see the Lord of the Island.

43
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,762
That's not possible.

44
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,765
Some important folks showed up suddenly,
and he's been in there since.

45
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,267
It's been hours now.

46
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,269
We're too late.

47
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,063
Let's go inside.

48
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,272
We can't do that.

49
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,400
If the elves get hold of the dungeon,
it's going to be over.

50
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,696
{\an8}My hometown also thrived
because of a dungeon.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,283
<i>But one day, monsters flooded out,</i>

52
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,953
<i>the elves came, and many lost their lives.</i>

53
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,957
<i>Why did my family have to die?</i>

54
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>My mother worked so hard
to raise me on her own.</i>

55
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>She didn't deserve to die like that.</i>

56
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,343
I don't want to see that happen again.

57
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,596
{\an8}The existing system,
where only certain races wield power,

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,390
{\an8}is detrimental to everyone involved.

59
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,189
Excuse us.

60
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,109
We've come to make a report
to the Lord of the Island.

61
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,487
What is it?

62
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,739
As you can see,
we're in the middle of a discussion.

63
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,241
We ask you to leave.

64
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,494
It concerns
the current condition of the dungeon.

65
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,037
Please hear us out.

66
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,292
<i>I mustn't be intimidated.</i>

67
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,044
Keep it brief.

68
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,922
Just earlier, while exploring the dungeon,

69
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>we encountered a human
who had been transformed into a monster.</i>

70
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,177
{\an8}-What?
-What?

71
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,221
Dammit. A Chimera.

72
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,931
It's advancing quicker than we thought.

73
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,850
See? What did I tell you?

74
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,602
I knew we couldn't afford
to leisurely wait for a response!

75
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,271
Order them to come ashore at once!

76
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,480
You have no right to do that!

77
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,858
Calm down, old man.

78
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,737
Borders become inconsequential
when lives are at stake.

79
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,157
You have no right to treat me as elderly!

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,743
Tansu, why don't we let them
have their way?

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,827
What?

82
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,620
I'm impressed, my lord.

83
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,247
You are flexible and wise.

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,249
Please place your seal here.

85
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,460
You mustn't! You can't!

86
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,588
That just made matters worse.

87
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,256
<i>If only...</i>

88
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,634
<i>I had the ability
to take control of the dungeon,</i>

89
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,136
<i>there wouldn't be an issue.</i>

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,804
<i>But it was beyond me.</i>

91
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,934
<i>So I began searching for ways
to assist other capable adventurers.</i>

92
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,106
<i>But the majority of them turned out
to be self-centered and insignificant.</i>

93
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,861
<i>Just as I resolved to tackle
the dungeon myself,</i>

94
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,739
<i>I heard rumors about the Touden siblings.</i>

95
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,866
He must come from good stock.

96
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,119
He's got good instincts,
but he's just too selfless.

97
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,913
Anyway, he's weird.

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,583
<i>The more I looked into him,
the stranger he seemed.</i>

99
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,337
<i>He's not particularly strong, yet he
somehow made it to the lower levels.</i>

100
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,673
<i>Giving money to folks with nothing
but bad gossip surrounding them.</i>

101
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,133
<i>His mysterious background.</i>

102
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,219
<i>His odd companions.</i>

103
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,847
<i>But for some reason,
I had a hunch that this man</i>

104
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,267
<i>might play a big part
in the fate of this island.</i>

105
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,938
<i>The question is
whether it'll be for better or worse.</i>

106
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,566
<i>I've been eager to talk with him in person
and form my own opinion.</i>

107
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,277
<i>And after finally conversing with him,
I've become convinced.</i>

108
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,614
<i>All he cares about are monsters.</i>

109
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,617
<i>He's incapable of considering
the future of the island.</i>

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,411
<i>It shouldn't be left in his hands,
but I'm sure of one thing.</i>

111
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,080
<i>Currently,</i>

112
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,000
<i>among all the tall-men, he's the closest
to reaching the heart of the dungeon.</i>

113
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,963
<i>This could be his one and only chance.</i>

114
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,757
<i>Therefore,
I can't let the elves interfere.</i>

115
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,552
{\an8}<i>Dealing with him must wait until later.</i>

116
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,637
I've had enough of this.

117
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,389
Do as you please.

118
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,390
My lord!

119
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,975
Give the order to come ashore.

120
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,184
Please wait!

121
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,646
The dungeon's layout, environment,
and the types of monsters within

122
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,773
are undergoing drastic changes.

123
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,150
It's extremely unstable.

124
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,277
We're well aware of that.

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,821
It's a natural occurrence
during a dungeon's expansion.

126
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,906
We must halt it without any delay.

127
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,075
It's similar to a person's growth spurt,

128
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,911
a phase that requires
the most nourishment.

129
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,163
What're you talking about?

130
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,290
Fifteen years ago, my hometown

131
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,959
was destroyed because of a dungeon.

132
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,795
It was a town called Utaya.

133
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,464
Fifteen years ago?

134
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,423
That means...

135
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,551
Are you the kid
who survived that incident?

136
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,472
I heard that the vice commander
at the time took you in.

137
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,389
That's right.

138
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
I was in her care for a few years.

139
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,392
Hmm.

140
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,936
She must've doted on you,
and yet you became an adventurer.

141
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,565
I dreamt of enlisting,
but the racial barrier stood in my way.

142
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,026
But I wanted to do what I could

143
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,361
to prevent another tragedy
like the one in my hometown.

144
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,863
How admirable.

145
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,198
Are you making enough to eat?

146
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,867
You should visit her and show her
how you're doing once in a while.

147
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,202
And?

148
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,787
You mentioned nourishment.

149
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,955
What about it?

150
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,207
Continue.

151
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,210
{\an8}Thanks to your efforts,

152
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,962
{\an8}the dungeon in Utaya collapsed swiftly.

153
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,217
<i>But many soldiers
and citizens lost their lives.</i>

154
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,344
<i>Because the dead turned into monsters</i>

155
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>and ate people alive.</i>

156
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,225
<i>I heard there were many soldiers
who were ambushed from behind.</i>

157
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,603
Even if you charge in with sheer numbers,
it will be like Utaya all over again.

158
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,231
I propose sealing the dungeon.

159
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,359
{\an8}We must not feed it.

160
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:51,155
Damaging the dungeon through combat
can't be what you want either.

161
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,115
What about the people still inside?

162
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,284
Most of them are on the first level.

163
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,703
We'll evacuate them gradually.

164
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,706
Everyone has some connections.

165
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,709
I know people I can reach out to
for assistance.

166
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,836
Please let me handle this!

167
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>This guy</i>

168
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,761
<i>ate monsters with a background like that?</i>

169
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,724
Hey, begin preparations.

170
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,519
-For an investigation.
-Huh?

171
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,147
{\an8}You're up to something, aren't you?

172
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,984
Since you insist,
let's see what you can do.

173
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,654
If anything happens,
we'll send in troops at once.

174
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,406
Am I clear?

175
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,074
Yes.

176
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,501
Is it like scrambled eggs?

177
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,502
Huh?

178
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,463
You once likened souls to eggs.

179
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,133
If two souls are blended together,

180
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,636
what kind of egg would that be like?

181
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,096
For example,

182
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,809
a scrambled egg is entirely different
from a sunny side up.

183
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,810
Listen.

184
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,562
I didn't use an egg to illustrate a soul

185
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,148
so you could jump on my words
and play with them.

186
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,649
Is that so?

187
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,528
I thought it was quite a clever metaphor.

188
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,616
Nothing has as many properties as an egg.

189
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,452
Consider, for example,
its coagulation temperature.

190
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,038
The whites and yolks coagulate
at different temperatures.

191
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,999
It can be whipped, used as a moisturizer,
and serve as an adhesive.

192
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,168
What's interesting
is its emulsifying ability.

193
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,838
Despite water and oil
being natural opposites,

194
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,591
eggs can blend them together nicely,
under the right conditions.

195
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,884
Like so.

196
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,011
Well...

197
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,388
True, why did I liken souls to eggs?

198
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,725
Laios, fetch me the bread over there.

199
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,570
It's done!

200
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,281
SOUL EGGS BENEDICT

201
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,785
How do you eat this?

202
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,287
Use a fork and knife.

203
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,248
Scoop up the yolk and sauce
with the bread.

204
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,048
Naturally, it's delicious.

205
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,551
Izutsumi,

206
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,554
would you stop glancing around at nothing?

207
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,931
Or do you actually see something?

208
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,307
Not really.

209
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,060
I just thought I sensed a presence.

210
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,937
What?

211
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,689
{\an8}Maybe what I'm seeing
isn't a hallucination!

212
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,691
Huh?

213
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,695
Well, the other day
when I had mana sickness,

214
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,490
I mentioned seeing
and hearing things, right?

215
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,325
It's been going on this whole time.

216
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,619
This whole time? Why didn't you tell us?

217
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,622
Because he'd be quick to think
there's something wrong with my head.

218
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,040
Am I wrong, though?

219
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,709
What are the hallucinations like?

220
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,715
I hear someone talking to me constantly.

221
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,718
<i>At first, I couldn't make out the words.</i>

222
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,097
<i>But over time, both its voice
and form have become clearer.</i>

223
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,475
<i>I was scared, so I've been
trying to ignore it, but...</i>

224
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,562
So you could hear me all along.

225
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,314
What did it say just now?

226
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,609
It's upset because I've been ignoring him.

227
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,736
Is it safe to talk with it?

228
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,280
Does it feel evil?

229
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,949
Yeah. If anything, I'd say so.

230
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,285
Hey.

231
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,953
How can I help you?

232
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,540
What's it saying?

233
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,877
It's upset I'm treating it like a fiend.

234
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,171
Also...

235
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,425
it's saying, "Aren't you grateful
I saved you from the magician?"

236
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,551
Huh?

237
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,387
<i>I remember now!</i>

238
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,015
That did happen, didn't it?

239
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,516
Thank it for us.

240
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,520
It wants us to meet someone.

241
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,897
What should we do?

242
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,732
This someone better not be a Grim Reaper.

243
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,901
Well, we don't really have other options.

244
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,070
Okay! Take us to this person!

245
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,611
What?

246
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,112
This place...

247
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,114
Hey!

248
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,116
Watch out!

249
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,702
A U-Unicorn!

250
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,499
You guys,
are you from outside by any chance?

251
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,377
No, we were in the dungeon and...

252
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,836
This is a big deal!

253
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,963
Come with me!

254
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,139
The monsters are so tame.

255
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,476
They're under orders not to hurt us.

256
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,771
But you outsiders are different.

257
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,482
Always keep the village's things on you.

258
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,777
Izutsumi, what's the matter?

259
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,279
Is it teleportation sickness?

260
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,030
Maybe the fatigue's getting to her.

261
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,492
Is that the Golden Castle?

262
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,410
Yup.

263
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,329
We were brought here by some ghosts.

264
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,415
Are they residents here?

265
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,541
They are.

266
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,878
But you can hear all about it
from the person you're about to meet.

267
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,631
I don't really understand
why you guys were chosen either.

268
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,883
"Chosen"?

269
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,677
Here we are.

270
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,803
Sit tight for a bit.

271
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,309
The master's gone to worship.

272
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,688
-It's them.
-What?

273
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,898
These guys?

274
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,443
Seems you were out of luck a bit.

275
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,947
Make yourselves comfortable in the village
until the master comes home.

276
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,701
{\an8}It seems like everyone's dying
to look after you guys, anyway.

277
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,078
{\an8}What should we show you?

278
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,205
{\an8}There isn't much to see in this village.

279
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,875
{\an8}Are they all residents
of the Golden Castle?

280
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,627
{\an8}I don't see any elderly people around.

281
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,922
{\an8}I want to see where the monsters are kept.

282
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,217
{\an8}I'd like to check out the fields
we passed on our way here.

283
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,637
What? That's what you're interested in?

284
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,847
Sure, we can take you there.

285
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,390
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

286
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,352
I'll wait here.

287
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,063
We can't leave Izutsumi alone anyway.

288
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,105
I'll stay too.

289
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,149
A-A Minotaur...

290
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,859
Female?!

291
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,737
They're our milk cows.

292
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,656
Why use monsters as livestock?

293
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,573
Huh?

294
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,117
Well, regular livestock
was hard to acquire.

295
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,255
This is a fine, well-tended field.

296
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,342
Do the villagers consume all the produce?

297
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,844
Actually, there's a lot of waste.

298
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,264
But without fields,
there's nothing for us to do.

299
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,559
We're maintaining them to replicate
our lifestyle from above ground.

300
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,727
Oh!

301
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,148
Izutsumi, are you okay?

302
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,404
<i>At least she doesn't seem to be unwell.</i>

303
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,865
Um, could we get a moment of your time?

304
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,411
Dresses?

305
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,495
Exactly!

306
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,247
We make clothes!

307
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,499
We usually take turns dressing up,

308
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,668
but it's become monotonous
with the same members.

309
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,837
I'd be happy to help.

310
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,297
Which one should we try?

311
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,174
I think we should go with red.

312
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,300
Sorry,

313
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,387
they might seem old-fashioned to you.

314
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,305
I wouldn't say that.

315
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,312
<i>This isn't quite what I was expecting.</i>

316
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,692
<i>I suppose being isolated from the outside
for a millennium would alter fashion too.</i>

317
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,068
Try these next!

318
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,573
That's good!

319
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,783
I'm pretty particular about my drinks,

320
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,452
but this is pretty decent.

321
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,786
I'm honored.

322
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,997
I serve it to orcs sometimes,

323
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,458
and the latest batches
have been quite popular.

324
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,294
It's really nice.

325
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,713
Do you happen to make wine as well?

326
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,716
I've actually just begun recently.

327
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,343
But compared to the ale
that I've been brewing for 400 years,

328
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,344
it's been a bit tricky.

329
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,929
Four hundred years?

330
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,681
That's a long-standing brewery!

331
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,141
What generation are you?

332
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,352
I began when I was 600 years old,
so I'm the first generation.

333
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,354
I see.

334
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,108
They let me milk a Minotaur!

335
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,610
That's cool.

336
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,236
Keep it to yourself.

337
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,988
This is incredible!

338
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,742
They've completely succeeded
in cultivating monsters here!

339
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,537
Just look at that vast Dryad farm!

340
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,664
They've got four nipples, just like a cow!

341
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,167
This is making me feel sick.

342
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,754
Anyway, it was an amazing experience.

343
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,422
Milking a...

344
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,925
Speaking of which,
where are Marcille and Izutsumi?

345
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,718
How did that bring them to mind?

346
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,137
S-Sorry for the wait.

347
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,269
What's up with your outfits?
You're having too much fun!

348
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,771
It's not like that!

349
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,773
They wanted us to, and we couldn't say no.

350
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,485
I did choose the tamest one, you know.

351
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,402
NOT TAME

352
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,655
Marcille, you...

353
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,116
W-What?

354
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,662
Why is Izutsumi so attached to you?

355
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,163
That's your question?

356
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,040
I wonder too!

357
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,336
It's like she's regressed to infancy.

358
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,296
Hmm!

359
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,464
No!

360
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,677
There are multiple barriers
layered on top of each other here.

361
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,180
So maybe they're somehow interfering
with something inside Izutsumi.

362
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,516
Because she's half-monster?

363
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,433
Yeah.

364
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,604
I've never encountered a barrier that
suppresses aggression in monsters before.

365
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,191
If only I could decipher this.

366
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,527
{\an8}But there are too many
unfamiliar characters,

367
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,945
{\an8}I can't solve it overnight!

368
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,824
Everything I try to study
is censored these days!

369
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,202
But this place is really amazing.

370
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,957
If it weren't for this situation,
I'd have loved to remain here forever.

371
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,418
Me too.

372
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,342
Sorry for the wait.

373
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,721
Although modest,
we've prepared a meal for you.

374
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,930
Please follow me.

375
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,020
Welcome, everyone.

376
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,730
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

377
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,773
My name is Yaad.

378
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,736
I'm the grandson of Delgal,
whom you must be familiar with.

379
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,070
Delgal...

380
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,864
Please take a seat.

381
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,493
I'll share with you the long tale
of why I've summoned you here.

382
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,370
Serve them.

383
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,666
VEGETABLES IN SLIME ASPIC
BEEF RIB STEAK

384
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,627
BLADE FISH LOAF
POTATO AND RABBIT SOUP

385
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,879
Um, what kind of meat is this?

386
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,049
Right. As your group
specifically requested,

387
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,759
it's Minotaur meat.

388
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,056
Do you regularly eat monsters too?

389
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,018
Some do,
but we generally don't eat at all.

390
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,772
Partly because
our sense of taste has diminished,

391
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,192
but in the first place,
we don't experience hunger at all.

392
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:40,739
That's the curse of immortality
the lunatic magician has placed on us.

393
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,036
Why did the magician do such a thing?

394
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,496
{\an8}Who knows?

395
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,706
{\an8}By the time I was old enough
to understand things,

396
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,252
{\an8}he was no longer in a state
to hold proper conversations.

397
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,464
But don't concern yourselves about us.

398
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,633
Please, enjoy your meal.

399
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:04,554
We might not feel any hunger,
but it pleases us to watch others eat!

400
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:09,059
<i>-I can't say I don't want to eat now!
-I can't say I don't want to eat now!</i>

401
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,437
My grandfather...

402
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:18,277
<i>blamed himself for turning
the magician's focus on black magic.</i>

403
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,279
<i>And he agonized over it for a long time.</i>

404
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,533
<i>Eventually, he headed to the surface
seeking assistance.</i>

405
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,578
How is my grandfather
known on the surface?

406
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,747
As far as I've heard,

407
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,709
he emerged suddenly from
an underground graveyard near a village.

408
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,669
<i>He named himself
the king of a fallen kingdom,</i>

409
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,840
<i>and offered the entire realm to anyone
who could defeat the lunatic magician.</i>

410
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,717
<i>Then, he turned to dust.</i>

411
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,468
Is that so?

412
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,221
At least there's some solace in knowing

413
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,473
that he has been liberated
from his suffering.

414
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,602
Many have left the village
seeking to escape the curse.

415
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,147
But none have succeeded.

416
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,566
They've simply lost their flesh.

417
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,570
<i>Without their bodies,
they gradually lost their identities,</i>

418
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,490
<i>transformed into fiends,
and are unable to return here.</i>

419
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,035
You must've encountered some of them.

420
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,369
<i>-We have!
-We have!</i>

421
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,122
-<i>We blasted them with holy water
-We blasted them with holy water</i>

422
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,874
-<i>and made sorbet out of it too!
-and made sorbet out of it too!</i>

423
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,126
S-So,

424
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,503
what's the reason behind inviting us here?

425
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,796
The prophecy.

426
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,839
The prophecy?

427
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,757
That's right.

428
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,010
"There will come one
bearing a winged sword,

429
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:29,890
who will defeat
the lunatic magician and free us."

430
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,099
Winged?

431
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,517
Does that mean Kensuke?

432
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,020
It does have wings, but...

433
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,148
Huh? It has a lion's face on it!

434
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,524
When did that happen?

435
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,944
<i>The Winged Lion
is the guardian deity of this kingdom.</i>

436
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,115
<i>The lunatic magician has imprisoned it
at the depths of the dungeon.</i>

437
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:52,788
<i>But even now, through dreams,
it prophesies the future and guides us.</i>

438
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,792
<i>My grandfather also left for the surface
because of a prophecy.</i>

439
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,544
Sir Laios,

440
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,922
the prophecy continues like this.

441
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,927
"The bearer of the winged sword
will defeat the lunatic magician,

442
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,680
and become the new king of this kingdom."

443
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,225
You've got the wrong person!

444
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,602
He only picked up this sword by chance!

445
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,020
It wasn't chance.

446
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:21,608
The fact that it's here now
suggests it was predestined.

447
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,195
Sir Laios,

448
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,948
will you give us your word?

449
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,826
That you will defeat the lunatic magician

450
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,036
and liberate us.

451
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,330
I...

452
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,373
Um...

453
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,339
Please let me think about it.

454
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,716
Just say no.

455
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,219
Why are you giving them false hope?

456
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,471
I can't just turn them down.

457
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,931
Kensuke,

458
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,600
when did you undergo your transformation?

459
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,146
It might have happened
when the Dungeon Cleaners got to it.

460
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,441
I was so nervous

461
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,236
that I couldn't really taste
the food they prepared.

462
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,446
You shameless bastard!

463
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,241
How dare you make a request on our behalf!

464
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,744
In truth, it barely had any taste at all.

465
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,999
They mentioned they don't need to eat.

466
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,544
That's why
their cooking skills are lacking.

467
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,255
I've been thinking.

468
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,926
<i>They shouldn't need fields or dishes.</i>

469
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,262
<i>So why do they have them?</i>

470
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:38,268
<i>Why do they persist in cleaning
and maintaining them for a millennium?</i>

471
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,897
It must be because they depended on them

472
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,568
to stay sane and to keep on living.

473
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,820
Laios,

474
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:54,743
I remember what you said to the orc chief.

475
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,660
Huh?

476
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,663
What did I say again?

477
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,083
Well, you should sleep on it for a night.

478
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,421
Can I stay here too?

479
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,465
Sleep in the room they prepared for you.

480
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,175
I don't want to be alone!

481
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,219
Izutsumi is acting weird too.

482
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,637
Scoot over.

483
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,180
Sleep on the floor!

484
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,265
<i>His hands were cold.</i>

485
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,948
