1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,737
Really, though.

3
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,533
There's nothing more horrifying
than black magic.

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,078
Was bringing this person back
worth going down that path?

5
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,580
It's only natural for Shuro to be furious.

6
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,501
Using shady methods
like that to resurrect someone?

7
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,336
That's just risky.

8
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,047
{\an8}Letting her stay dead
would've been better for her...

9
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,090
{\an8}Enough!

10
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,176
I understand your point,

11
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,512
so please stop.

12
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,558
Sorry.

13
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,520
Shuro, deep down, you probably know

14
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:30,483
that if you were in his shoes,
you'd have done the same thing.

15
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,818
I know that!

16
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,863
But his attitude is just too much!

17
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,906
We fed on monsters!

18
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,534
I think my favorite is the Red Dragon
because of the memories.

19
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,452
Check this out! It's a monster sword!

20
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,290
{\an8}We may have used black magic,
but you won't tell anyone, right?

21
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,170
{\an8}Anyway, I have no idea
what's going on in your head.

22
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,714
{\an8}I doubt I'll ever understand.

23
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,716
{\an8}So I can't help you.

24
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,718
Laios! Senshi!

25
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,386
We've got trouble!

26
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,598
A group of monsters
is attacking the cooking crew and...

27
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,392
{\an8}What have you done?

28
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,604
{\an8}I told him everything
that's happened so far.

29
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,606
Everything?!

30
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,774
I thought that Shuro would understand.

31
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,776
Shuro's the last person
you should have told!

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,694
I figured.

33
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,279
Is this on me?

34
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,740
Did I make the wrong call?

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,117
Don't beat yourself up.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,244
He's just a little tired.

37
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,707
<i>I have a lot of respect for him.</i>

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,502
<i>He's helped me out countless times
on our adventures.</i>

39
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,256
<i>He told me tales of foreign lands</i>

40
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,884
<i>when all I've known
was my homeland and this island.</i>

41
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,512
<i>Shuro's always been cool-headed and smart.</i>

42
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,225
For him to explode like that,

43
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,019
I must've really messed up.

44
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,940
It'd be a shame
if our friendship ended like this...

45
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,782
Harpies.

46
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,287
This is getting us nowhere.

47
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,205
Asebi!

48
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,498
Let's go, you three!

49
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,713
Laios told Shuro everything
that's happened so far.

50
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,049
What? Is that why the air is so tense?

51
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,176
Shuro's furious.

52
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,177
What do we do?

53
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,971
If the story gets to the surface, we...

54
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,974
I know! I know, but...

55
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,478
It looks like the ninjas
are handling things just fine.

56
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,147
{\an8}Anyway, who else knows?

57
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,399
{\an8}Four people for now.

58
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,567
{\an8}Shuro and two of his retainers,

59
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,237
{\an8}and that curly-haired guy.

60
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,743
He's the guy whose party
was wiped out by Treasure Bugs, right?

61
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,037
What's he doing here?

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,205
Who knows?

63
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,875
Maybe he's after
whoever stole their loot and food.

64
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,211
W-We have to clear that up!

65
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,132
The loot was just Treasure Bugs
and the food was drenched and ruined!

66
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,591
You idiot!

67
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,219
The bigger problem
is your use of black magic.

68
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,930
Shuro is angry, but he's not a concern.

69
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,851
He's just ticked off
we put Falin in danger.

70
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
{\an8}But I'm not sure about the others.

71
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:17,233
{\an8}By the way, how much evidence
is left of you using black magic?

72
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,654
The magic circle
got erased by the Cleaners,

73
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:26,242
but there might be trouble if they check
Falin's body and my staff too closely.

74
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,369
We need to torch your staff right now!

75
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,537
Wait a minute!

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,082
If they're already onto us that much,
burning my staff won't make a difference.

77
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,959
Huh?

78
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,504
Over there, look!

79
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,967
What's that monster?

80
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,010
A Harpy?

81
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,386
No.

82
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,073
What?

83
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,032
No.

84
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,533
No.

85
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,534
How?

86
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,536
Falin...

87
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,915
It can't be.

88
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:16,959
No.

89
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,921
{\an8}What on earth?

90
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,553
<i>It's so cool!</i>

91
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,849
<i>But it's a little too greedy.</i>

92
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,310
<i>It's got wings, feathers, and scales too.</i>

93
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,269
Falin!

94
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,355
Do you recognize me?

95
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,815
Knock it off, Marcille!

96
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,066
Falin!

97
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,403
-Holm! Rin! Prepare for battle!
-Falin!

98
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,321
-R-Right!
-Right.

99
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,657
-Laios, Shuro! What's the plan?
-Falin!

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,783
Tell us what to do!

101
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,160
Inutade, don't hurt her!

102
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,662
Try to restrain her!

103
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,163
Uh. Huh?

104
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,499
No, Young Master. Run...

105
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,729
So, I need to restrain her.

106
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,606
Restrain her without hurting her.

107
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,191
Restrain her without hurting her?

108
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,623
Can you do it, Holm?

109
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,916
Y-Yeah.

110
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,335
All right.

111
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,253
Come out.

112
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,068
Falin!

113
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,945
A-An Undine?

114
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,780
Are you controlling that?

115
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,324
Please make it stop!

116
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,409
She's just confused.

117
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,204
Give me a break.

118
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,081
You don't care how many people die

119
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,667
if you can protect someone
dear to you, is that it?

120
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,670
That thing isn't "her."

121
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,547
It's just a monster!

122
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,054
<i>Ludeloes Arnbite.</i>

123
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,563
Oh, Marillier...

124
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,232
It can even cast spells?

125
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,122
No, Kuro!

126
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,624
Don't, you fool! Stay hidden!

127
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,628
Falin...

128
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,593
Out of my way!

129
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,346
<i>Andarses Orbis!</i>

130
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,822
<i>Monsters are dangerous.</i>

131
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,157
<i>Damn it, Kensuke!</i>

132
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,117
<i>Never trust a monster...</i>

133
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,706
Forgive me, Falin.

134
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,376
I wish I could've
switched places with you.

135
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,387
{\an8}My big brother, Laios.

136
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,691
Falin!

137
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,651
The lungs, kidneys,

138
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,528
and the heart!

139
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,374
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

140
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,587
Can you stand?

141
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,631
I'm sorry I hesitated.

142
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,591
You're right.

143
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,217
My sister's soul

144
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,262
is probably under the control
of the lord of the dungeon now.

145
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,059
But if we kill her,
the lunatic magician will show up again.

146
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,645
For now, we need to get out of here.

147
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,188
But...

148
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,282
Falin!

149
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,285
Hey!

150
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,333
You monster!

151
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,128
<i>Ludeloes Ejectulm Hemtum.</i>

152
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,089
This spell...

153
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,091
Everyone, stay close to me!

154
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,182
Essiet!

155
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,212
She might return.

156
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,131
Let's get the wounded inside the barrier.

157
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,174
And the dead...

158
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,843
What should we do?

159
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,470
I'll resurrect them.

160
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,639
I can't revive everyone, though.

161
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,475
Should I gather the bodies?

162
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,811
No, don't move them.

163
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,397
We can't waste a drop of shed blood.

164
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,444
Where's the monster?!

165
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,737
It bolted. We're safe now.

166
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,489
Who's next?

167
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,407
Wait.

168
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,492
Bring back that woman first.

169
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,996
Why me?

170
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,916
{\an8}You seemed to be a powerful mage.

171
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,836
{\an8}So I thought you could use
healing and resurrection magic.

172
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,173
{\an8}He can't heal everyone alone.

173
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,343
{\an8}You helped us get here,
so this is the least we can do.

174
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,678
{\an8}So now I owe you.

175
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,847
My guess is
you're after a different spell.

176
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,849
Never mind.

177
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,184
Let us get this done quickly.

178
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,270
Um, I can use
basic resurrection magic too.

179
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,188
No.

180
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,482
Don't you lay a finger on them.

181
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,235
I can't let you use any more black magic.

182
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,988
I-I wouldn't do that.

183
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,573
Then what was that?

184
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,617
Why did she look like that?

185
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,953
It's because you used the Dragon's flesh
and black magic on her!

186
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,997
No! That can't be!

187
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,082
The magic didn't have that kind of power.

188
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,669
{\an8}B-But it's possible that

189
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,507
{\an8}the Red Dragon's soul
was under some spell.

190
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,259
And Falin's soul merged with the Dragon's,

191
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,137
and the lunatic magician
transformed her into that creature.

192
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,348
Shuro?

193
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,433
{\an8}I'm handing Marcille over
to the elves of the west.

194
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,394
I can't kill that thing.

195
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,730
But I can't let it roam free either.

196
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,484
I want to free her soul from the dungeon

197
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,653
and let her rest in peace at least.

198
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,488
But...

199
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,698
The elves will know how to do that.

200
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,744
{\an8}Confess everything
to the elves of the west.

201
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,412
No, Shuro.

202
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,248
There has to be another way.

203
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,582
Give me a break!

204
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,751
What have you been doing until now?

205
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,628
Another way?

206
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,754
What's your plan?

207
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,798
Are you going to keep resurrecting her

208
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,425
with different monster parts
until she's back to normal?

209
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,469
Go on, tell me!

210
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,721
What are you going to do?

211
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,473
You have an idea, don't you?

212
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,849
Tell me!

213
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,649
We'll defeat the lunatic magician!

214
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,112
That Red Dragon
was clearly following orders.

215
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,074
Who else but the magician who created
this dungeon could command it?

216
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,328
So, we'll take down the magician
and rewrite his orders!

217
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,039
I'm not familiar with this sort of thing,

218
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,458
but Marcille should know how!

219
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,252
That's why I won't let you take her!

220
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,921
I've had enough!

221
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:45,301
{\an8}Are you really going to use black magic
to fix a problem caused by black magic?

222
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,720
{\an8}Why don't you start
taking things seriously for once?

223
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,061
Uh... sorr...

224
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,489
It's true I'm not the most skilled,

225
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,075
and you're stronger than most adventurers.

226
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,954
But here's what I know.

227
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,832
We've been getting
proper meals three times a day

228
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,459
and good sleep too.

229
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,252
That makes us more serious than you!

230
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,296
Listen to me!

231
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,676
We will take down the lunatic magician
and rescue Falin, no matter what!

232
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,346
Shuro, you go back to the surface.

233
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,349
Eat, bathe, and rest!

234
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,562
{\an8}Huh? What was that?

235
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,816
Shut up!

236
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,071
The fight isn't over yet.

237
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,824
If that's your plan, I have one of my own.

238
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,867
Plan?

239
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,328
Laios!

240
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,454
Listen up.

241
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,414
For a long time now,

242
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,626
I couldn't stand your guts.

243
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,129
Because you were thoughtless, dense,

244
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,589
<i>and always had the worst timing!</i>

245
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,508
Hey, tell me more
about those foreign lands!

246
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,927
Are you two eating together? Count me in!

247
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,054
We're friends now, right?

248
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,224
<i>It was even worse
because you meant no harm!</i>

249
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,518
Why don't I just end you here,

250
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,852
take Marcille, and...

251
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,562
Well, you should've told me sooner!

252
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,564
Why were you keeping quiet until now

253
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,610
if you couldn't stand me and thought
I was dense and had terrible timing?

254
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,114
{\an8}I was dropping hints
that most people would've picked up on!

255
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,492
You should've made
more of an effort to notice!

256
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,493
How could I?

257
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,997
You were the first friend
I made on this island,

258
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,791
and I was too excited to realize!

259
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,586
See, that's another thing
I can't stand about you!

260
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,672
You act all honest

261
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,799
but end up stressing people out!

262
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,301
How was I supposed to know?

263
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,221
You never speak up and you don't even eat!

264
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,516
What's the point of having a mouth?

265
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,268
Shut up, you moron!

266
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,563
You haven't put in
half the effort Marcille has.

267
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,773
We don't have time for this.

268
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,608
It's a childish squabble.

269
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,361
I must have raised him wrong.

270
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,489
Seven dead, including myself,

271
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,200
one in critical condition,
and three missing.

272
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,621
The gnome and I will resurrect them,
but we're low on blood.

273
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,250
Senshi, can you gather
the scattered ingredients?

274
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,877
Sure.

275
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,546
I can use basic resurrection magic too.

276
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,423
You stay out of this.

277
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,013
Heal the wounded and find the missing.

278
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,682
If you try anything suspicious,
I'll cut you down on the spot.

279
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,793
See, Shuro?

280
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,213
Right now, I'm better fed than you are.

281
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,547
That's why I'm stronger!

282
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,341
D-Damn it.

283
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,689
It's good.

284
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,443
Young Master, we've resurrected everyone.

285
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,113
When do you wish to depart?

286
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,075
No, prepare the return magic.

287
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,159
We're heading back up.

288
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,994
Are you sure?

289
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,831
Asebi is still missing.

290
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,040
She probably ran off.

291
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,958
Let her be.

292
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,670
Please forgive our inadequacy.

293
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,088
No.

294
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,465
You did your best.

295
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,467
Thank you.

296
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,553
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

297
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,976
I'm returning to my homeland.

298
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,937
I'll never set foot on this island again.

299
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,316
I'll report what happened
to the Lord of the Island.

300
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,485
I see.

301
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
I wish I could've returned with Falin.

302
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,741
What was her answer to your proposal?

303
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,742
I don't know.

304
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,371
She said she needed time
to think about it.

305
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,498
I was waiting for her answer.

306
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,759
<i>There's no woman
more fascinating than her.</i>

307
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,598
<i>I loved her voice, the way she thought,</i>

308
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,684
<i>and her smile.</i>

309
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,983
But I never actually
brought any of this up with her.

310
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,278
I wish I had told her sooner.

311
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,157
{\an8}Wait, so he just popped
the question out of nowhere?

312
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,408
{\an8}That's scary.

313
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,202
{\an8}From where he comes from, it's normal.

314
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,788
I see. Well, I'll pass on
your words to Falin.

315
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,794
That's the part about you

316
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,131
that I envy.

317
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,679
Kabru, you were a big help.

318
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,097
I didn't do much.

319
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,016
My attack ended up being useless.

320
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,852
No, it helped me notice
a couple of things.

321
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,187
Like what?

322
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,273
The places you stabbed
would've been fatal for a human,

323
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,192
but not for my sister.

324
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,654
This means either that
she doesn't have vital organs there,

325
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,405
or she has more somewhere else.

326
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:45,869
A bunch of monsters like the Basilisk,
Cerberus, and Scylla have multiple brains.

327
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,163
It's pretty common in Chimera types.

328
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,999
<i>His pupils are dilated.</i>

329
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,252
<i>He must really love monsters.</i>

330
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,671
<i>So his knowledge is his weapon.</i>

331
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,423
<i>He says he'll defeat the lunatic magician.</i>

332
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,885
<i>There are plenty of adventurers
more skilled than him,</i>

333
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,055
<i>but none with his level
of knowledge and motivation.</i>

334
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,433
<i>This guy might just pull it off.</i>

335
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,811
<i>But</i>

336
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,022
<i>what happens after he defeats
the lord of the dungeon?</i>

337
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,400
<i>They say whoever
takes down the lunatic magician</i>

338
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,819
<i>will gain everything in the kingdom.</i>

339
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,116
<i>What if that means becoming
the next lord of the dungeon?</i>

340
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,663
<i>What will he do with this city built
by black magic and all its monsters</i>

341
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,081
<i>when he inherits them?</i>

342
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,209
<i>Will he quietly seal the dungeon?</i>

343
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,670
Aren't you hungry?

344
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,754
Huh?

345
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,606
HARPY EGG OMELET

346
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,276
What's this?

347
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,695
It's an omelet made from a Harpy egg.

348
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,158
Senshi found an egg earlier.

349
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,493
You seemed interested in monster cuisine,

350
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,078
so have one.

351
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,084
<i>Mother!</i>

352
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,587
<i>I'd rather die than eat it!</i>

353
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,922
<i>What do I do? How do I get out of this?</i>

354
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,051
<i>No, maybe I have no choice
but to kill him now.</i>

355
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,635
<i>Not now!</i>

356
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,720
I'll try one!

357
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,055
<i>Typical of Kabru.</i>

358
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,433
<i>He'll do anything to win someone's favor.</i>

359
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,060
<i>What a nice guy.</i>

360
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,575
The return magic is ready.

361
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,244
No one is injured, yes?

362
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,704
Beyond this portal is the surface.

363
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,498
If you die there, we can't bring you back.

364
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,416
To be honest,

365
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,378
I think you'll die before you
even get to the lunatic magician.

366
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,006
But if you do manage to survive,

367
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,760
but can't make it back to the surface
because of black magic,

368
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,012
ring this bell.

369
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,265
It'll resonate with its twin far away.

370
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,520
I'll send an escort
to help you flee to the east.

371
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,314
Don't die.

372
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,775
Thanks.

373
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,653
Laios,

374
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,404
I'm glad we got to chat.

375
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,281
That was the highlight
of this trip for me.

376
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,783
The pleasure is mine.

377
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,409
Um...

378
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,744
Quickly now.

379
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,622
You remember my name now, right?

380
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,374
Huh? Of course.

381
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,750
Good.

382
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,254
Don't forget next time.

383
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,257
Well, see you.

384
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,384
<i>Next time?</i>

385
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,178
Let's go, Laios!

386
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,472
There's no turning back now.

387
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,183
{\an8}Crap. See?

388
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,353
{\an8}I just knew this was going
to happen in the end.

389
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,312
{\an8}Crap!

390
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,398
{\an8}That's vulgar, Chil.

391
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,066
I'm sorry.

392
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,113
It'll all work out somehow.

393
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,873
