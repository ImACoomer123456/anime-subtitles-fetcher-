1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,812
Drop your weapons now.

3
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,400
Back up and lie on your stomach.

4
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,070
If you twitch a muscle, I'll kill her.

5
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,032
{\an8}Isn't she one of Shuro's retainers?

6
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,827
{\an8}Was she following us this whole time?

7
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,578
You.

8
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,163
Undo these spells.

9
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,081
Huh?

10
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,166
The spells I'm under!

11
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,334
Get to it!

12
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,212
W-What kind of spells are you under?

13
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,839
Can't you tell by looking?

14
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,133
You wield black magic, don't you?

15
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,093
At least clue me in
on what they're cast on

16
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,345
and what kind of magic they are.

17
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,100
There are two types of spells on me.

18
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,227
One's on my neck.

19
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,687
And the other...

20
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,604
Huh?

21
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,401
Is all over my body.

22
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,572
{\an8}Is she a beast-man?

23
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,614
{\an8}Yeah.

24
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,741
{\an8}I've seen one a long time ago.

25
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,744
An engineered beast-man.

26
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,582
Apparently, they're made with black magic,
mixing human and beast souls together.

27
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,336
Fine. I'll do what I can.

28
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,256
This...

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,967
{\an8}looks like it's written
in the Eastern script.

30
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,594
{\an8}What kind of spells are they?

31
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,971
{\an8}Can't you tell by looking?

32
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,683
{\an8}They activate when the spellcaster
goes without touching them for a while.

33
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,519
{\an8}Is the spellcaster the one called Maizuru?

34
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,354
{\an8}How much time do you have left?

35
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,481
{\an8}What happens when you run out of time?

36
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,441
{\an8}Who knows?

37
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,151
{\an8}You might want to hurry.

38
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,778
You don't want to die with me, do you?

39
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,823
I'll let you go once you undo the spells.

40
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,493
<i>The writing is peculiar.</i>

41
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>But I have a feeling I can undo them.</i>

42
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,496
{\an8}Hey, you brat.

43
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,414
Huh?

44
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,874
Fetch me something to eat.

45
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,841
FIELD RATION PELLET

46
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,512
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

47
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,016
If you shovel it in that fast,
you'll choke.

48
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,226
Shut up.

49
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,102
I'll prepare something hot for you.

50
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,604
Hey! Did I say you could move?

51
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,521
Whoa!

52
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,232
Don't underestimate...

53
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,570
{\an8}You need something to moisten your throat.

54
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,530
{\an8}I'll fix you something. That's all.

55
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,575
{\an8}If you try
to feed me monsters, I'll kill you.

56
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,410
Deal.

57
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,251
I'm pretty sure I picked up some mushrooms
around where the Dryads were.

58
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,129
<i>They're starting to sprout
leg-like things.</i>

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,299
<i>Must be my imagination.</i>

60
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,344
<i>I'll set my pot on the magic circle,</i>

61
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,181
<i>melt some butter,
sauté some garlic,</i>

62
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,391
<i>and toss in the rice.</i>

63
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,394
<i>Then I'll add
the mushrooms and seasonings,</i>

64
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,980
<i>pour in some water,
and let it stew for a bit.</i>

65
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:43,908
<i>The fact that this is all I can make
makes me feel useless and pathetic.</i>

66
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,413
<i>At any rate, I can't stand the idea
of young ones going hungry.</i>

67
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,414
<i>But at least,</i>

68
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,666
I can throw in some cheese.

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,501
It's done.

70
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,170
RISOTTO WITH MUSHROOMS FROM A GRAVEYARD
AND CHEESE FROM ORCS

71
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,131
I'll put it here.

72
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,841
You think I'd eat that?

73
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,438
<i>This kid...</i>

74
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,190
<i>Her table manners</i>

75
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,483
<i>are terrible!</i>

76
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,694
Give me more!

77
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,489
{\an8}Is etiquette different
in the East or something?

78
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,784
{\an8}We never saw Shuro eating like that.

79
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,704
She simply had a poor upbringing.

80
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,748
Guess that's unfamiliar to you.

81
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,756
-Huh?
-Huh?

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,597
Why did you do that?

83
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,890
I hate mushrooms.

84
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,016
<i>She's picky!</i>

85
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,143
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

86
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,144
<i>Senshi...</i>

87
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,773
Your spoon.

88
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,026
Hold your spoon properly.

89
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:00,985
Hey!

90
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,987
If you come any closer, I'll kill you!

91
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:07,742
Hold your spoon the right way
and pick up what you threw on the floor.

92
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,494
-What'd you say?
-Hey!

93
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,620
Don't!

94
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,247
It's risky to move
when I'm undoing your spell!

95
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,097
Hold your spoon like this.

96
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,807
W-Who cares how I hold it?

97
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,226
This way is easier for me!

98
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,019
I'm not surprised.

99
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,481
Having someone force you to hold a spoon
in an unfamiliar way must be annoying.

100
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,398
However...

101
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,733
Senshi, behind you!

102
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,029
Huh?

103
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,115
<i>I didn't feel anything.</i>

104
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,617
<i>Is this paper?</i>

105
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,744
Senshi, watch out!

106
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,669
That's a carving knife,
a type of knife used for cutting meat.

107
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,132
It's got a long, sharp blade
that can look pretty intimidating,

108
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,134
but it's thin and delicate.

109
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:10,513
If you wave it around like that,
what do you think is going to happen?

110
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,472
Senshi!

111
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,069
Just like that, you might not get
the most out of your tool,

112
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,780
leaving yourself at a disadvantage.

113
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,580
Senshi!

114
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,081
Now, Laios!

115
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,176
Are you hurt, cat girl?

116
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,679
I'm sorry for giving you a fright.

117
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,597
However,

118
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,101
there are right
and wrong ways to hold a tool.

119
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,562
I want you to think about
why that's the case.

120
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,648
{\an8}And why you shouldn't move
while a spell's being undone.

121
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,319
{\an8}If the spells had been nastier,
who knows what might've happened.

122
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,448
The food's gone cold.

123
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,116
I'll reheat it quick.

124
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,369
So?

125
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,705
Why were you coming after us?

126
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:23,669
All this time, I've been looking for a way
to break the curses on my body.

127
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,758
Turns out, these curses
were placed by black magic.

128
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,011
But I could never find anyone
who could wield black magic.

129
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,473
Until I crossed paths with that long-ears.

130
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,226
Black, I mean ancient magic
comes in all sorts.

131
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,853
My research is mainly about
drawing energy from another dimension...

132
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,771
Don't give me that!

133
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,023
I know you can do it!

134
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,651
I mean, you've done it before!

135
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,196
<i>You wielded black magic
to create that eerie half-beast creature!</i>

136
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,992
And you're all
trekking through this dungeon

137
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,702
to break the curse on that woman, right?

138
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,914
That means you know how to break curses!

139
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,416
In that case, you can free me too!

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,587
Get rid of this beast's soul
that's possessing me!

141
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,132
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,261
There's nothing I can do about that.

143
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,179
What?

144
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,140
<i>There's a lot we don't know
about the soul.</i>

145
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,434
<i>But it's often likened to an egg.</i>

146
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,146
<i>Normally, it's nestled inside
a shell we call flesh,</i>

147
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,816
<i>but once the flesh is broken,
the insides spill out</i>

148
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,401
<i>and can't be put back again.</i>

149
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,571
<i>This dungeon is under a spell</i>

150
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,407
<i>that forms a tough membrane
beneath the shell,</i>

151
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,034
<i>keeping the soul inside
even when the body is damaged.</i>

152
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:43,291
At the moment, you and Falin
have got two eggs inside one shell.

153
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,627
And once mixed together,

154
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,879
those souls can never go back
to their original form.

155
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,676
<i>I knew that, but hearing it
laid out like that hits differently.</i>

156
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,761
{\an8}What?

157
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:00,224
{\an8}If that's the case,
why press on with your journey?

158
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,439
One reason is
we can't just let my sister run wild.

159
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,191
She might kill the next adventurer
she crosses paths with.

160
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,110
Or get herself killed by them.

161
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,779
We want to do something
before that happens.

162
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,116
And if we return to the surface now,

163
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,368
we'll be apprehended
for dabbling in black magic.

164
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,580
Shuro will likely tell the Lord
of the Island about this incident.

165
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,749
But...

166
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,127
Does this mean I'm stuck like this?

167
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,087
No, listen to me!

168
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,008
I know this might sound weird,
but I'm honestly glad to have met you.

169
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,344
{\an8}I'm not sure what kind of monster
you're mixed with,

170
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,846
{\an8}but your behavior is just like a human's.

171
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,765
{\an8}And you're not out for blood either.

172
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,935
So, maybe even Falin,
once she's free from the dungeon's grip,

173
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,521
might be able to reclaim her true self.

174
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,275
Just realizing that makes me

175
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,569
so very happy right now.

176
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,279
Here.

177
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,116
Maybe things didn't unfold
exactly as you'd hoped,

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,077
but why not look at it
from a positive angle,

179
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,828
like it was fate at work?

180
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
The lord of the dungeon

181
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,125
is way more skilled
with ancient magic than I am.

182
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:13,798
He might have some insights
on how to separate souls.

183
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,757
Hold up.

184
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,051
Are you trying to recruit me?

185
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,513
Either way, you can't make it back
to the surface by yourself.

186
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,182
Was your name Asebi or something?

187
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,226
That's just the name I go by.

188
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,227
Then...

189
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,311
It's Izutsumi.

190
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,271
My name is Izutsumi.

191
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,439
Don't forget.

192
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,453
Laios, how much longer are you going
to keep living like this?

193
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,871
Father.

194
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,082
It's about time
you started living a proper life.

195
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,961
I didn't let you go out there
just so you could go off slaying dragons.

196
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,587
Come back to the village!

197
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,423
But Falin's still...

198
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,299
Forget about her.

199
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,303
Do you really believe someone like you
can make it out there

200
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,807
{\an8}when you ran away from both school
and the army because you couldn't fit in?

201
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,310
You don't even have the knack
for exploring the dungeon.

202
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,646
Just like back when you were gold-peeling,

203
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,732
your comrades will deceive you
and take credit for your achievements.

204
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,735
Because you're clueless
when it comes to reading people.

205
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,988
It was the same with me.

206
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,158
You believed we were close friends,

207
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,951
but I've always loathed...

208
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:24,994
Would you let that go?

209
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,662
We've already talked it out.

210
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,372
Wait, hang on.

211
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,875
<i>Why are my parents here?</i>

212
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,127
<i>I haven't seen them in over a decade.</i>

213
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,004
<i>And where am I?</i>

214
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,630
<i>What was I up to?</i>

215
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,215
<i>I think I was...</i>

216
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,888
<i>Lately, Marcille</i>

217
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,682
<i>seemed kind of worn out.</i>

218
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,519
Marcille, we'll take care
of keeping watch tonight.

219
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,729
You rest.

220
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,147
Huh? But why?

221
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,398
Don't worry about me.

222
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,567
Come on. Just rest.

223
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,485
Hey!

224
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,403
Ugh, what are you doing?!

225
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,239
I'm not that tired, you know.

226
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,033
I'll be up in a bit.

227
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,743
I can't be the only one to...

228
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:10,748
<i>But before long, her quiet breathing
turned into distressed groans.</i>

229
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,834
What's the matter, Marcille?

230
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,461
This isn't something to take lightly.

231
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,545
Is it a monster?

232
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,797
Yeah, I think it's a Nightmare.

233
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,967
<i>They prey on humans in their sleep,
inflicting them with nightmares,</i>

234
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,552
<i>and feed on their emotions.</i>

235
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,139
If this goes on,
Marcille will weaken and die.

236
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,350
Wake up, Marcille!

237
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,102
Don't. If you force her awake,
you'll harm her soul.

238
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,566
When Shuro was possessed before,
Falin entered his dreams to rescue him.

239
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,069
Let's try that.

240
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,363
You're going to enter her dream?

241
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,324
Someone needs
to help her realize she's dreaming.

242
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,911
{\an8}Use the dreamer as a pillow and...

243
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,338
<i>Right. I was trying to help Marcille.</i>

244
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,924
{\an8}I'm inside my own dream!

245
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,094
The Nightmare got an easy bite out of me.

246
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,470
It's always like this.

247
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,722
They sure know how to hit where it hurts!

248
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,351
But now that I know it's just a dream,
I've got the upper hand.

249
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,271
Come forth, my mightiest servant!

250
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,237
<i>Now, I need to enter Marcille's dream.</i>

251
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,365
Since she's serving
as my pillow right now,

252
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,451
I'll have to dig down.

253
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,249
This is the beauty of dreams.

254
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,084
This only works inside
your own dream, though.

255
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,799
That was a close one.

256
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,427
That fall almost jolted me awake.

257
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,764
So this is what
Marcille's dream looks like.

258
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,893
Pretty cool.

259
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,144
Is someone there?

260
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,104
What are you doing?

261
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,940
This place is dangerous.
You need to get out fast.

262
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,818
Marcille?

263
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,737
W-Who are you?

264
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,322
It's me, Laios!

265
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,824
And we're inside your dream!

266
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,827
You need to wake up and...

267
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,786
A tremor?

268
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,414
It's coming!

269
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,416
W-We need to run!

270
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,584
What's coming?

271
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,960
Just follow me!

272
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,214
<i>It swallowed Papa and Pipi.</i>

273
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,799
<i>Papa and Pipi?</i>

274
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,719
<i>A dream about being chased, huh?</i>

275
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,305
<i>Those are pretty common, but nasty.</i>

276
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,474
<i>I remember Falin mentioning...</i>

277
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,894
Nightmares thrive on emotional scars.

278
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,105
Stressful events and trauma.

279
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,026
They trigger those memories
and give people nightmares.

280
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,197
So all we have to do
is shield their scars.

281
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,281
I see.

282
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,699
But...

283
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,285
It's dangerous, so don't try it.

284
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,245
All right. I got it!

285
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,623
I'll take it down for you!

286
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,250
{\an8}What are you doing? It's too risky!

287
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,919
{\an8}Don't worry.

288
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,754
I might not seem like it,
but I'm actually...

289
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,393
What in the world is that?

290
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,061
How should I know?

291
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,064
<i>Is that what Marcille's afraid of?</i>

292
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,733
<i>It's quite a bit over the top,</i>

293
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>but it does look like
it'll be tough for me to take down.</i>

294
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,657
<i>It wouldn't be a threat if she realized
this was all just a dream, though.</i>

295
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,034
We've come far enough.

296
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,912
Nowhere is safe.

297
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,456
Nobody stands a chance against it.

298
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,501
Don't worry.

299
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,461
Let's think of a way
to take it down together.

300
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,173
<i>What is Marcille afraid of?</i>

301
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,592
<i>A monster, of course.</i>

302
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,303
<i>It crawls sluggishly,</i>

303
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,973
<i>has countless tentacles
and an insatiable hunger,</i>

304
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,933
<i>and looks disgusting.</i>

305
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,852
<i>Is it some kind of insect?</i>

306
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>But bugs that size are pretty rare.</i>

307
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,858
<i>Bugs...</i>

308
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,109
<i>That's it!</i>

309
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,736
It's a Wurm!

310
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,612
It's a Wurm from the Dragon family!

311
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,615
Its legs and eyes have degenerated,
so it's more like a giant caterpillar.

312
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,368
It's voracious
and devours anything living!

313
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,370
It's weak to fire and light!

314
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,956
Pretty classy choice!

315
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,583
Huh?

316
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,586
When did it...

317
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,880
Hold on!

318
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,758
R-Run!

319
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,510
Did that thing touch you?

320
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,095
Just a brush.

321
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,013
Show me!

322
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,642
What's this?

323
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,028
<i>Damn.</i>

324
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,780
<i>I frightened her even more!</i>

325
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,032
<i>It'll only make the Nightmare stronger.</i>

326
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,288
<i>What a potent poison.</i>

327
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,957
<i>What happens if you die
in someone else's dream?</i>

328
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,128
<i>No, it wants us
to feel anxious and scared.</i>

329
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>I have to lift Marcille's spirits.</i>

330
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,298
Don't worry!

331
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,509
You can use magic!

332
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,011
You can take that thing down
all by yourself!

333
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,055
Magic?

334
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,354
<i>The place is getting even more unstable.</i>

335
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,189
<i>Did I say something wrong?</i>

336
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,315
When...

337
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,236
When I tried to use magic to defeat it,

338
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,405
she ended up like this.

339
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,699
She?

340
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,202
Wait, is that Falin?

341
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,954
<i>I get it now.</i>

342
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,081
<i>Marcille feels guilty
about Falin's transformation</i>

343
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,041
<i>due to her resurrection magic.</i>

344
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,710
<i>If she tried
to defeat that thing, it means...</i>

345
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,296
<i>Marcille is afraid of death!</i>

346
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,549
I-It's coming back!

347
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,593
{\an8}Running won't solve anything.

348
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,554
{\an8}You have to face it head-on.

349
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,596
{\an8}What?

350
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,933
Don't worry.
There's nothing for you to fear!

351
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,853
In the dungeon, even if you die,
you can come back to life.

352
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,356
Even Falin is still alive
thanks to your resurrection magic.

353
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,650
And you're used to seeing corpses, right?

354
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,360
What?!

355
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,117
{\an8}It's pulling me in!

356
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,368
{\an8}No!

357
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,120
{\an8}It's only pulling me!

358
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,705
Grab my hand!

359
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,376
<i>It's not poison.</i>

360
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,129
<i>I'm aging at an incredible rate.</i>

361
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,631
W-Wait a minute, Marcille.

362
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,924
I need to catch my breath.

363
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,510
<i>Something's not right.</i>

364
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,263
<i>Is there a creature capable of this?</i>

365
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,724
<i>Maybe it's not even a creature at all.</i>

366
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,393
So you won't come along with me either?

367
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,354
No, I can run again after a short rest.

368
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,272
You're lying!

369
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,860
Everyone who ran with me gave up,
and they were all swallowed by that thing.

370
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,363
Papa, Pipi, Falin, everyone!

371
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,700
That's why I studied a lot of magic.

372
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,037
But if that's what turned Falin into this,

373
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,289
I don't know what to do.

374
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,710
Did your father pass away young?

375
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,422
At Papa's funeral, Mama told me

376
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,051
<i>that I run faster than everyone else.</i>

377
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,472
<i>That I'd have to watch
a lot of people go away.</i>

378
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,600
By the way, is Pipi a relative of yours?

379
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,684
Pipi's a bird.

380
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,810
<i>I see.</i>

381
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,606
<i>Marcille isn't afraid of death.</i>

382
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,026
<i>She's worried that those she cares about
will pass away before her.</i>

383
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,201
Marcille, calm down!

384
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,204
If you're scared,
it'll just empower that thing.

385
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,873
But what am I supposed to do?

386
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,083
I can't do anything!

387
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,709
No, you can!

388
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,212
You're incredible, Marcille!

389
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,714
I mean, just look at all these books!

390
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,300
There was nothing like that in my dream!

391
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,470
You've been working tirelessly
all this time!

392
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,056
Don't lose heart. Have faith in yourself!

393
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,350
You've got this, Marcille!

394
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,352
No, get up!

395
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,812
We have to run!

396
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,980
And besides,

397
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,732
{\an8}my magic isn't fully developed!

398
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,235
<i>If I had the same book he does,</i>

399
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,530
<i>I could use magic more effectively, but...</i>

400
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,865
Then wish for it!

401
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,618
If you wish hard enough,
you can accomplish anything!

402
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,746
Don't be afraid!
You can do better next time!

403
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,373
Don't give up!

404
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,626
No!

405
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,628
No!

406
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,346
That's it, Marcille!

407
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,389
Do it!

408
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,236
That's how you use it?!

409
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,325
You're awake.

410
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,243
You were both groaning in your sleep.

411
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,369
Are you okay?

412
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,872
I don't really remember.

413
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,499
It was an exhausting dream, though.

414
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,213
She's falling back asleep!

415
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,382
No! Wake up, Marcille!

416
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,760
My dream?

417
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,636
I don't remember much.

418
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,598
But I think it was a fun one.

419
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,308
Looks like it worked.

420
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,893
Did something happen?

421
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,519
Pass me your pillow.

422
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,520
Huh?

423
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,608
What are those?

424
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,026
Nightmares.

425
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,696
They hide in people's pillows
and give them bad dreams.

426
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,574
There are so many of them.

427
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,868
They must have been
nesting in your pillow for a while.

428
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,786
No way!

429
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,662
Senshi, are these edible?

430
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,748
I've always been curious
about their flavor.

431
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,208
Yes, of course.

432
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,169
First, let's clean the gunk off.

433
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,048
If you soak them in hot water like this...

434
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,135
Nightmares, also known as Shen,

435
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,012
are actually related to Dragons.

436
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,056
If you look closely,
they're a bit Dragon-like.

437
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,432
You're kidding me.

438
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,269
<i>Place the Nightmares in melted butter,</i>

439
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,647
<i>add some wine, and cover with a lid.</i>

440
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,195
<i>Finally, drizzle a bit
of soy sauce over them,</i>

441
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,696
and it's done.

442
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,283
What's this?

443
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,452
That's me!

444
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,039
The dream that the Nightmares devoured
turned into a mirage.

445
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,708
It's coming back to me.

446
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,751
Right,

447
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,837
I was running from something

448
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,505
<i>when a dog appeared.</i>

449
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,968
And we went on a treasure hunt together.

450
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,303
It was such a fun dream!

451
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,305
The dog seems a bit scruffy.

452
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,974
It looks dumb.

453
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,684
What's wrong, Laios?

454
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,855
I remember it being a silver wolf, but...

455
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,189
Never mind.

456
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,192
I'm glad if I helped in creating
a fun dream for her.

457
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,957
