1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,938
It wasn't just a myth, after all!

3
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,316
That fallen ancient kingdom
actually existed!

4
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,821
This is pure gold.

5
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,072
Incredible.

6
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,073
Hey...

7
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,868
Shouldn't we head back up
to the surface once?

8
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,579
If we want to explore,
we should be better prepared.

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,290
Stop talking nonsense.

10
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,375
Senshi,

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,336
are you sure you have
iron flowing in your veins?

12
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,879
Don't push yourself.

13
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,464
You wait here.

14
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,968
I want gold too!

15
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,972
{\an8}<i>I was terrified
of being left behind, so I lied.</i>

16
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,392
<i>That place just didn't sit right with me.</i>

17
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,603
<i>And although many of my group
were ambitious from the start,</i>

18
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,064
<i>they were acting weird then.</i>

19
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,276
<i>Their eyes were gleaming in the dark,</i>

20
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,363
<i>and they kept plunging deeper and deeper
like they were being pulled in.</i>

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,242
<i>Then suddenly, it began.</i>

22
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,037
What happened?

23
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,125
A-A monster!

24
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,128
A giant bird monster
showed up out of nowhere

25
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,255
and took out Totan!

26
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,215
This isn't just some old ruins.

27
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,050
It's turned into a dungeon!

28
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,889
<i>By the time fear had jolted everyone
back to themselves,</i>

29
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,308
<i>we realized we'd lost our way back.</i>

30
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,270
What if we've been trapped in here?

31
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,774
All dungeons
have a way out to the surface.

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,028
Let's keep our cool
and hunt for that exit.

33
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:19,490
<i>We kept roaming the dungeon,
avoiding any monsters.</i>

34
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,536
<i>Curiously,when we became thirsty,
we stumbled upon springs.</i>

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,081
<i>When we were exhausted,
rooms would pop up for us to rest in.</i>

36
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,670
<i>Some even got tempted
by a gorgeous woman in the shadows.</i>

37
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,799
<i>Eventually, our food ran out.</i>

38
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,302
If we keep going like this,
we'll starve and die.

39
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,055
We must find something to eat,
even if it means fighting.

40
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,348
Something to eat?

41
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,809
Even monsters must feed on something.

42
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,394
Invar, Brigan!

43
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,481
Use your shields to be on guard.

44
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,567
Null and I will fend off monsters
with our weapons.

45
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,944
Senshi...

46
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,989
You stay put
and work on mapping out this area.

47
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,075
Let's go!

48
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,875
That bird monster showed up again!

49
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,462
That damn thing flies off too fast.

50
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,299
I-I'll join you on the next food hunt!

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,468
No, you'll just slow us down.

52
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,637
We've found food.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,347
Here, have this.

54
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,850
<i>Even though I wasn't exerting myself,
I still became hungry.</i>

55
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,270
<i>I felt so pathetic.</i>

56
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,233
<i>Our daily hunt for food
became more urgent than finding the exit.</i>

57
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,903
<i>The bird kept on our tails relentlessly.</i>

58
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,239
<i>With each fight, our numbers dwindled.</i>

59
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,740
<i>Finally, with nothing else to eat,</i>

60
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,493
<i>we had to resort to killing our horse.</i>

61
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,497
That four-legged eagle...
there's no mistaking it.

62
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,083
It's a monster called a Griffin.

63
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,585
Why is it so fixated on us?

64
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,879
It doesn't seem like
it's hungry or anything.

65
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,300
It probably just enjoys
the thrill of the kill.

66
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,594
They say monsters are like that.

67
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,848
Don't worry.

68
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,892
Next time it swoops in,
we'll roast it whole and feast on it.

69
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,229
Here. Be grateful to Anne and eat up.

70
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,319
What's up with you,

71
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,530
giving the biggest portion
to the useless brat?

72
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,783
He's only 36 and still needs to grow.

73
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,953
As grown-ups,
it's our duty to take care of him.

74
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,288
We can't afford to do that!

75
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,375
{\an8}It's over for us when we can't look after
the next generation anymore!

76
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,430
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

77
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,725
<i>If iron really does flow through my veins,</i>

78
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,227
<i>I wonder if I can munch on rocks.</i>

79
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,187
Hey!

80
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,564
You've got a hidden stash of food,
haven't you?

81
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,941
Stop it! What's gotten into you?

82
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,526
That brat!

83
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,570
Let's discuss this outside.

84
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,822
You're scaring Senshi.

85
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,325
-How many times do I have to tell you?
-Why you! Shut up!

86
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,328
<i>The shouting kept getting louder.</i>

87
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>I heard the sounds of scuffling
and a few screams.</i>

88
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,217
<i>Then, it went eerily silent.</i>

89
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,512
What happened?

90
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,429
Where's Brigan?

91
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,722
Stay put!

92
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,225
Don't look outside.

93
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,937
We were attacked by the Griffin.

94
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,941
I took down the Griffin,
but Brigan died instantly.

95
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,693
<i>When I looked at Gillin's head,</i>

96
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,531
<i>there was a dent in his helmet,
like it had been hit by a blunt object.</i>

97
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,325
Let's eat the Griffin.

98
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,328
If we clean it and make a soup out of it,

99
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,539
we could survive a few more days.

100
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:12,181
<i>The Griffin soup, just boiled with water,
had a gamey smell and the meat was tough.</i>

101
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,891
<i>It tasted awful.</i>

102
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,521
<i>But I chewed intently</i>

103
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,066
<i>and downed it slowly, taking my time.</i>

104
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,112
<i>Gillin said he needed to relieve himself,</i>

105
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,239
<i>and stepped outside unsteadily.</i>

106
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,119
<i>But he never returned.</i>

107
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,830
<i>I found myself all alone.</i>

108
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,126
<i>I lacked the courage
to peek outside the door,</i>

109
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,837
<i>and I was unable to leave the room.</i>

110
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,883
<i>I survived on the meat that was left</i>

111
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,343
<i>and pored over the maps I had sketched.</i>

112
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,389
<i>Eventually, I noticed a pattern
in the symbols etched on the walls.</i>

113
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,767
<i>When I finally gathered the courage
to step out of the room...</i>

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,107
<i>there were no bodies to be found.</i>

115
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,903
<i>They must have been devoured cleanly
by various creatures.</i>

116
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,823
<i>Later, I was captured by orcs,</i>

117
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,993
<i>and held captive
in their settlement for some time.</i>

118
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,080
<i>But when I tried to communicate with them,
they turned out to be quite decent folk.</i>

119
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,666
<i>In exchange for teaching them
ancient Dwarvish,</i>

120
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,212
<i>they taught me how to distinguish
between edible and poisonous mushrooms,</i>

121
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,797
<i>and how to handle encounters
with monsters.</i>

122
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,051
<i>And that's how...</i>

123
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,309
<i>I made it back to the surface.</i>

124
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,980
<i>But after everything that happened,</i>

125
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,816
<i>I couldn't find it in me
to return to my hometown.</i>

126
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,320
<i>So, I lived near the dungeon
or in its upper levels.</i>

127
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,407
<i>Eventually, the city on the surface
connected with the dungeon,</i>

128
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,202
<i>and many adventurers began venturing down.</i>

129
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,204
<i>What weighed on my mind</i>

130
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,917
<i>was whether the meat I consumed
truly came from the Griffin.</i>

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,837
<i>Every time I eat,
I'm haunted by the taste of that soup.</i>

132
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:11,717
<i>No other monster
tasted anything like that.</i>

133
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,429
That's why I fled from the Griffin.

134
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,143
I'm afraid of discovering the truth.

135
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,979
I had no idea...

136
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,897
Senshi...

137
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,734
Then why not try eating that Griffin?

138
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,860
-Huh?
-Huh?

139
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,113
I mean, it's awful for him

140
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,741
to be haunted by that memory every time
he eats for the rest of his life.

141
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,785
If it tastes the same,
he can put his mind at ease.

142
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,829
And if it's completely different,

143
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,249
well, it's a shame,
but at least it won't plague him anymore.

144
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,209
It's going to plague him even more.

145
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,544
What's with him?

146
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,713
What do you think, Senshi?

147
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,634
You're right.

148
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,136
I should try it.

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,887
Senshi...

150
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,806
All right then!

151
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,435
Let's recreate the cooking
as closely as possible.

152
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,812
We'll cut out the meat
without doing much to it.

153
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,149
Since the upper body and lower body
might taste completely different,

154
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,275
we'll take cuts from both.

155
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,152
You just want to eat it.

156
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,325
That's some impressive muscle.

157
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,035
It's not a carnivore for nothing.

158
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,830
Why did the Griffin pursue
Senshi and his group so relentlessly?

159
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,292
It might have killed people,
but it didn't seem keen on eating them.

160
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,128
They had a horse though.

161
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,171
Maybe that's why.

162
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,048
Griffins have a penchant for horses.

163
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,259
But then why didn't it target
the horse first?

164
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,177
No idea.

165
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,679
I'll get some water boiling.

166
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,726
<i>The Griffin's weapons
are its front claws and beak.</i>

167
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,563
<i>It can't leave a dent on you
like you were hit by a blunt object.</i>

168
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,941
<i>So whatever killed Brigan
probably wasn't a Griffin.</i>

169
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,445
<i>But what about the other three?</i>

170
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,865
<i>Just like how we mistook
Falin for a Griffin,</i>

171
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,159
<i>maybe it was
a different monster altogether.</i>

172
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,870
<i>There are many large monsters with wings.</i>

173
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,832
<i>The Cockatrice, Basilisk, Harpy, Siren,</i>

174
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,919
<i>Pegasus, Simurgh, and Roc.</i>

175
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,422
<i>Which of these monsters possesses
a weapon resembling a blunt object?</i>

176
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,883
The water's boiling.

177
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,552
Do we just let it boil like this?

178
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,346
Should we add other ingredients?

179
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,555
No, that's it.

180
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,100
<i>It's going to be a bland soup.</i>

181
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>It'd be nice if we had some garnish.</i>

182
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,941
By the way, you mentioned that the orcs
taught you how to distinguish mushrooms.

183
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,026
But is this your first time
seeing these mushrooms?

184
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,820
Yeah, I've never seen them before.

185
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,990
Marcille, I'm leaving the rest to you.

186
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,575
-Huh? Hey!
-Huh?

187
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,953
You've come this far,
and now you're backing out?

188
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,079
So flighty!

189
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,289
Fine, forget it then.

190
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,250
This won't help Senshi anyway.

191
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,461
No, we've come this far, so let me try it.

192
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,047
I'll accept whatever truth awaits me.

193
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,180
GRIFFIN SOUP (UPPER BODY)
(LOWER BODY)

194
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,223
It's done.

195
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,981
This...

196
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,860
doesn't taste anything like
what I had that day.

197
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,323
What I ate back then must have been...

198
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,284
You mean...

199
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,201
It's fine.

200
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,162
A weight has been lifted.

201
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,207
Gillin must have wanted me to survive,
no matter what.

202
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,169
I'll carry on with that wish.

203
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,129
Laios, you moron!

204
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,547
What have you done?!

205
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,387
Griffin meat is very gamey and tough.

206
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,806
More than anything,
the aftertaste is just awful.

207
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,100
{\an8}That's right.

208
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,312
{\an8}Senshi didn't eat Griffin meat that day.

209
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,899
But it wasn't human flesh either!

210
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,569
What attacked them was a Hippogriff,
not a Griffin.

211
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,196
A Hippogriff?

212
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,490
Unlike a Griffin,
which has the lower body of a lion,

213
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,533
a Hippogriff
is a close relative of a horse.

214
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,078
It likely kept chasing them down
because they had a horse.

215
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,456
Maybe it was curious or in heat.

216
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,959
Plus, a Hippogriff
has a weapon a Griffin lacks.

217
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,754
<i>Hind legs with hooves.</i>

218
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:21,008
<i>Its kick could tear through metal,
leaving a sizable hole.</i>

219
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,678
I assure you, Senshi!

220
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,515
If what you had that day was a Hippogriff,

221
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,351
then it's only natural
it would taste different from this soup.

222
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,814
Thank you, Laios.

223
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,526
I feel a bit better hearing that.

224
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,488
Even though there's no way
to confirm what a Hippogriff tastes like.

225
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,408
{\an8}Let's find out then.

226
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,993
{\an8}-Huh?
-Huh?

227
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,746
{\an8}Let's compare it to Hippogriff meat.

228
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,457
I thought you were going
to wrap it up with something like,

229
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,919
"The truth remains uncertain,
but now there's a glimmer of hope."

230
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,838
I mean, where would we
even find a Hippogriff?

231
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,507
Well,

232
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,134
we have a Hippogriff right here!

233
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,263
There must have been reports of one
in this dungeon in the past.

234
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,807
{\an8}So why didn't we notice them?

235
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,602
{\an8}Because we were fighting a Griffin
that shouldn't even be in this dungeon.

236
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,520
{\an8}Why is that?

237
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,148
Because the presence
of an accomplice complicated things.

238
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,025
An accomplice?

239
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,153
Changelings.

240
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,491
Now that I think about it,
that legend comes from your hometown.

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,202
Ever heard of Changeling Children?

242
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,289
It's a phenomenon
where children are swapped with monsters.

243
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,794
<i>A child who goes to play in the woods
returns home as an identical troll.</i>

244
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,672
<i>For a long time, they were believed
to be a type of magic.</i>

245
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,923
<i>But recently,</i>

246
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,176
<i>it's been discovered that it's the work
of these mushroom-like monsters.</i>

247
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,931
<i>Those who step into a ring of them
undergo a subtle change.</i>

248
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,850
Once people learned about this,

249
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,144
they eradicated the mushrooms,
and now they're rare.

250
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,021
To think we'd find them growing here.

251
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,399
<i>The way the Griffin seized Senshi
but didn't eat him.</i>

252
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,527
<i>The sharp kick that killed the Familiar.</i>

253
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,114
<i>It's likely that
the Griffin we fought was actually...</i>

254
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,116
Let's find out.

255
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,163
Place Griffin meat
inside a Changeling fairy ring.

256
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,500
The meat looks different.

257
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,920
It's marbled with fat and looks delicious.

258
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,380
All right, let's make soup from this.

259
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,929
HIPPOGRIFF SOUP

260
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,781
S-Senshi?

261
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,284
W-Well, flavors can vary depending on
conditions and environments,

262
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,786
so I wouldn't worry about it...

263
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,956
No. That's not it.

264
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,917
I've been wanting

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,504
to taste this soup again for a long time.

266
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,052
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

267
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,263
Thank you.

268
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:20,771
Living in this dungeon for a long time
has made me realize something.

269
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,692
This dungeon responds strongly
to a person's desires,

270
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,028
whether it's wealth, knowledge, or fame.

271
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,951
It's accommodating to those like orcs
who don't seek anything from it.

272
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,287
But the moment you desire something,
it shows its fangs.

273
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,456
From now on,

274
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,962
<i>not only will you aim to rescue Falin,
but you'll also be searching</i>

275
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,548
<i>for the lunatic magician
and the Winged Lion.</i>

276
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,552
The dungeon's response
will become even more severe.

277
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,053
Still,

278
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,975
there are many things I want to teach you.

279
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,352
Will you take me with you?

280
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,438
Of course!

281
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,986
Okay, everyone!

282
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,446
Let's get going!

283
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,039
How are you all feeling?

284
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,416
I'm feeling cold.

285
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,375
I might not make it.

286
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,920
{\an8}<i>This has to be food poisoning, right?</i>

287
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,424
{\an8}<i>I mean, we've eaten all sorts of things.</i>

288
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,594
{\an8}<i>But we can't afford to die here.</i>

289
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,345
<i>Falin...</i>

290
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,601
<i>How long was I out?</i>

291
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,852
<i>I feel lighter.</i>

292
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,229
<i>Has the food poisoning passed?</i>

293
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,397
<i>Good.</i>

294
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,232
<i>I was afraid that...</i>

295
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,987
What's going on?

296
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,239
Marcille.

297
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,532
Look at me.

298
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,367
Does my body look strange to you?

299
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,624
Marcille has shrunk too!

300
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,958
Senshi, this is bad!

301
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,502
Wake up! Sen...

302
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,880
W-Who are you?!

303
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,842
What's with all the racket?

304
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,843
Chil...

305
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,763
Chilchuck, sir?

306
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,854
It looks like
we stepped on some Changelings.

307
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,816
H-How is this even possible?

308
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,485
They transformed a Griffin
into a Hippogriff.

309
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,904
They could do this to people.

310
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,656
I'm a dwarf now.

311
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,407
Senshi is an elf.

312
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,660
Marcille is a half-foot?

313
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,662
And Chilchuck is a tall-man.

314
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,580
Izutsumi...

315
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,207
is a dog.

316
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,459
No, I think that's a kobold.

317
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,128
A kobold with cat ears.

318
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,921
Now,

319
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,674
how do we get back our bodies?

320
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,426
We'll have to retrace our steps.

321
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,179
If we step inside a mushroom ring,
we'll be able to revert, right?

322
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,348
That's my assumption,

323
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,683
but take a look outside.

324
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,060
The path has shifted.

325
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,564
While we were laid up,
I couldn't stop shaking.

326
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,525
Are you saying it was the dungeon,
not my body, that was shaking?

327
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,944
I'm not sure we can make it back,

328
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,696
but let's return to the reservoir.

329
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,202
<i>The luggage feels really light.</i>

330
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,205
Marcille, I'll carry some of your stuff.

331
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,832
Thanks.

332
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,168
<i>I'm liking this body.</i>

333
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,253
<i>I can see well in the dark.</i>

334
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,839
<i>I might even be able to beat Namari
in an arm wrestle now.</i>

335
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,216
Chilchuck, how's that body of yours?

336
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,597
It feels like I'm enveloped in a heavy,
transparent, and thick membrane.

337
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,516
So, your senses are dulled?

338
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,726
Yeah.

339
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,187
But it's strangely calming.

340
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,482
Oh, and it's also nice to be able
to look down on you guys.

341
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,634
Wait, is this door...

342
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,724
Ugh, this is where
we were originally headed!

343
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,351
The deepest point, huh?

344
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,896
We intended to turn back,
but ended up pressing forward.

345
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,232
Someone set up camp here.

346
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,151
It seems other adventurers have been here.

347
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,322
Do you think
they might know how to fix us?

348
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,701
I doubt they ventured beyond this door.

349
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,287
They might have already
teleported back to the surface.

350
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,915
What do we do then?

351
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,917
{\an8}I've been thinking...

352
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,544
{\an8}why don't we continue searching
for the Winged Lion like this?

353
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,545
{\an8}Huh?

354
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,466
The dungeon
doesn't seem inclined to release us.

355
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,720
Instead of wasting time resisting it,
it might be quicker to press onward.

356
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,055
Of course,

357
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,016
once we make it back to the surface,
I'm sure there'll be plenty of solutions.

358
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,102
I'm not suggesting
we stay like this forever.

359
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,103
{\an8}That's absurd!

360
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,981
{\an8}Just because you've become
a long-lived race...

361
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,315
{\an8}He has a point.

362
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,652
{\an8}I haven't experienced
any inconvenience so far.

363
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,571
{\an8}So what if the size of our ears
is a little different anyway?

364
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,243
Say we press on then.

365
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,495
What's the plan for that door?

366
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,831
Everyone's fussing
because it won't open, right?

367
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,375
Do you think you can unlock it, Chilchuck?

368
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,920
Well, it'd need to have a lock
in the first place.

369
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,839
I think it operates with magic.

370
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,384
I can sense magic flowing through it,

371
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,095
but deciphering it would require
time, equipment, and money.

372
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,017
Yaad, what do we do about this?!

373
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,145
Help us, Winged Lion!

374
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,062
-Hey!
-Hey!

375
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,605
Hey!

376
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,691
Laios, something's sprouting!

377
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,985
Kensuke?!

378
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,612
Why is it growing?

379
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,866
I thought the bitter cold had killed it.

380
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,206
The door...

381
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,169
Do you think
the Winged Lion is helping us?

382
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,379
It could be thanks to Yaad.

383
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,089
We should thank them all the same.

384
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,218
-Thanks, Lion or Yaad!
-Thanks, Lion or Yaad!

385
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,765
There! I thought I saw something move!

386
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,858
It's a Gargoyle!

387
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,777
Here it comes!

388
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,362
As you can see,
Gargoyles are moving stone statues.

389
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,532
Striking them will only end up
hurting you, so be careful.

390
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,410
{\an8}<i>There's nothing I can do here.</i>

391
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,496
{\an8}<i>I'll back off so I won't get in their way.</i>

392
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,417
Huh? Why is it coming after me?

393
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,628
Because you stand out the most!

394
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,047
You're big, so you should fight too!

395
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,632
Don't be ridiculous! I can't...

396
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,720
Chilchuck!

397
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,597
It's okay! It wasn't a direct hit...

398
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,061
{\an8}Marcille?!

399
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,064
{\an8}E-Everything's swirling
with rainbow colors.

400
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,525
{\an8}Is it mana sickness? With just one attack?

401
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,859
{\an8}This is bad.

402
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,153
{\an8}Izutsumi, cover Chilchuck's back.

403
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,323
Stay!

404
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,366
No, Izutsumi.

405
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,701
Don't move until I say so!

406
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,579
<i>The loud noises and the smell of blood
are getting her all riled up.</i>

407
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,374
<i>If she starts fighting,
she won't stop until she's dead.</i>

408
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,750
Senshi, grab the pot!

409
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,587
Senshi? Why aren't you holding anything?

410
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,589
Because it's too heavy.

411
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,638
<i>Never mind. The sword and pot
feel much lighter than usual.</i>

412
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,349
<i>At this rate, I can win on my own.</i>

413
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,267
<i>Except...</i>

414
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,894
<i>how do I put it?</i>

415
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,521
<i>This body...</i>

416
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,023
<i>is really exhausting!</i>

417
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,025
<i>Damn, we're going to lose.</i>

418
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,111
Everyone, get out of here!

419
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,780
Senshi, carry Marcille
and head behind that door.

420
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,282
Izutsumi.

421
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,826
Follow this bell!

422
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,413
Chilchuck, take this pot lid!

423
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,456
Run for it!

424
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,637
Oh no.

425
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,099
This body is seriously inconvenient.

426
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,935
And there's no going back now.

427
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,937
It can't be helped.

428
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,982
Let's just hope those mushrooms
are growing ahead.

429
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,990
This is a genuine dwarf relic.

430
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,785
Do those mushrooms grow around here too?

431
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,495
It's really hot.

432
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,624
Maybe we should start cooking.

433
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:06,755
Now I get why Senshi
always starts cooking out of the blue.

434
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,467
This body gets really hungry.

435
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,263
I've never seen Namari
randomly start preparing food though.

436
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,309
Cooking is perfect for self-reflection.

437
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,772
<i>Knead together flour, water,
salt, and egg thoroughly,</i>

438
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>then let it rest.</i>

439
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,153
<i>Meanwhile, combine chopped onions
and other vegetables with minced meat,</i>

440
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,905
<i>and mix well.</i>

441
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,407
<i>Shape the rested dough into a long stick.</i>

442
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,534
<i>Cut it into equal pieces,</i>

443
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,161
<i>and roll each piece into thin sheets.</i>

444
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,539
<i>Place the filling onto
the rolled-out dough then wrap it up.</i>

445
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,041
<i>Keep wrapping.</i>

446
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,761
It's strange.

447
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:59,140
Working in silence
is helping me calm down.

448
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,017
Aren't we making too much?

449
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,435
That turned out really nicely.

450
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,565
It's done.

451
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,277
BOILED HIPPOGRIFF DUMPLINGS

452
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,155
The shape is familiar,
but the smell is totally different.

453
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,448
It's kind of odd.

454
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,534
No potato or cheese in them, huh?

455
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,036
Back in my hometown, we usually fry them.

456
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,038
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

457
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,128
Careful not to burn yourself.

458
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,170
Say that first!

459
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,047
Is it just me

460
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,216
or does it taste surprisingly good?

461
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,677
Do racial differences affect taste too?

462
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,180
No, I think anyone would find this tasty.

463
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,682
It's strange, isn't it?

464
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,644
{\an8}Every region and race has its own
different ways of cooking dumplings,

465
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,771
{\an8}yet they all taste delicious.

466
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,316
R-Right!

467
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,277
It's just like us right now.

468
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,114
Even though some things have changed,
we're still ourselves.

469
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,699
We'll make it work.

470
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,160
That wraps things up nicely, doesn't it?

471
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,078
Only in your head.

472
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,457
Anyway, this place is odd.

473
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,125
I wonder what it was.

474
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,587
It's a defensive stronghold
built by dwarves, right?

475
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,255
Defensive?

476
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,050
From when the elves
and dwarves were at war.

477
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,552
Didn't you learn about it in school?

478
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,972
They competed to develop
more and more advanced technology,

479
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,308
which eventually led to a catastrophe.

480
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:28,146
Elves and dwarves
are afraid of history repeating itself,

481
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,066
which is why they're prickly
about technology in the dungeon.

482
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,320
This dungeon, in particular,
is where many cultures intersect,

483
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,365
so I imagine we're going to have
a lot of conflicts when elves step in.

484
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,575
Yeah, a-about that.

485
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:44,871
If we run into trouble with the elves,
you can do something about it, right?

486
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,456
Huh? Why me?

487
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,542
You said your mom worked at the court.

488
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't you have connections?

489
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,462
W-Well...

490
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,880
Now, now.

491
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,216
Anyway, she's a half-foot now.

492
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,843
{\an8}If anyone's going to negotiate
with the elves, it's Senshi.

493
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,889
I'll do what I can.

494
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:08,061
Actually, we should keep searching
for a way to revert back.

495
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,729
-Agreed.
-Agreed.

496
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,856
