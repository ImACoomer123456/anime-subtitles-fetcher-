1
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,401
Footsteps.

3
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,196
What a surprise.

4
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,864
They really are grilling meat.

5
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,661
I hope they're not criminals or that sort
who aren't allowed back on the surface.

6
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,412
We're just camping.

7
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,414
We mean no harm.

8
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,167
Wait a minute, I know that voice.

9
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,002
Just as I thought!

10
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,420
It's you, Laios!

11
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,922
-Namari!
-Namari!

12
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,215
You know them?

13
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,675
They're my former party members.

14
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,844
Hey, it's been a while.

15
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,679
Well, I guess it's only been a week.

16
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,848
Oh, let me introduce these people.

17
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,351
These are my current employers,
Mr. and Mrs. Tansu.

18
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,104
They work as someone's personal scholars,

19
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,106
and they pay really well.

20
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,608
And these two are the twins,
Kaka and Kiki.

21
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,486
To be honest,
I can never remember who's who.

22
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,115
Namari, how can you act like this

23
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,993
after abandoning Falin?

24
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,536
Abandon?

25
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,498
I simply refused
to walk into the jaws of death for free.

26
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,209
You...

27
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,879
Marcille, take it easy.

28
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,048
Hey, don't push yourselves.

29
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,051
Falin wouldn't want
anything to happen to you.

30
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,720
Right.

31
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,889
Is there a healer in your party?

32
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,599
My friend needs treatment.

33
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,851
What do we get in return?

34
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,440
We have Kelpie meat.

35
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,357
No, thanks!

36
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,234
Let's go, Namari.

37
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,446
Handing out charity in a dungeon
just sets you up to be taken advantage of.

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,616
Seriously, even that corpse
we stumbled upon on our way here

39
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,242
had their own revival fee with them.

40
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,745
Are you going to move on ahead?

41
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,122
There's an Undine roaming around,
and it's dangerous.

42
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,665
An Undine?

43
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,711
So, this girl
angered a water spirit, did she?

44
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,048
Don't underestimate us.

45
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,302
We gnomes have been living alongside
gods and spirits since ancient times.

46
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:45,516
To us, spirits are like neighbors,
not something to be afraid of.

47
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,520
Undine!

48
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh, mighty water spirit!

49
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,109
Heed my voice and respond to me!

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,153
This isn't working.

51
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,324
Grandpa Tansu!

52
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,625
It didn't work.

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,919
N-Namari!

54
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,587
Namari died!

55
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,130
She'll recover in no time.

56
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,926
<i>Ira Fa Lane Brete Lane Bretego.</i>

57
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,390
Damn you, you old geezer!

58
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,767
You're always using me as your shield!

59
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,853
That's why I compensate you handsomely!

60
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,522
Resurrection magic, huh?

61
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,984
It's a magic
I especially can't bring myself to like.

62
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,403
You're against resurrection?

63
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,406
It's not a pleasant sight to witness.

64
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,450
It's unnatural for the dead
to come back to life.

65
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,788
Outside the dungeon, sure,
but in here, it's normal.

66
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,039
It's not normal.

67
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,583
It's not normal, Laios.

68
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,085
That's right.

69
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,131
This dungeon
is under a very powerful enchantment.

70
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,093
<i>It binds your soul to your body.</i>

71
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:06,848
<i>So, no matter how damaged your body gets,
your soul is never released.</i>

72
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,809
<i>And once your injuries are mended,
you can be revived.</i>

73
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,644
In my perspective,

74
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,689
this isn't the dead coming back to life.

75
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,401
In this place, death itself is forbidden.

76
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,113
It is a truly dreadful curse.

77
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,823
But that aside,

78
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,702
I study such ancient spells.

79
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,080
I came here to investigate
a magic circle in this area,

80
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,834
but as you can see,
my escort isn't very dependable.

81
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,047
If you help me with my investigation,

82
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,340
I will heal your companion.

83
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,848
Deal.

84
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,726
Senshi and I will accompany you.

85
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,858
This should be the area.

86
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,028
Elven characters.

87
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,113
What terrible penmanship.

88
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,199
The roots are in the way. Remove them.

89
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:14,290
Laios, you still have that creepy sword?

90
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,417
I keep telling you, but...

91
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,753
"Use one from the shop," right? I know.

92
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,588
You have to get one crafted by a dwarf.

93
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,174
And avoid shops
that are tended by a half-foot.

94
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,009
And don't use the same scabbard.

95
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:25,927
And...

96
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,013
{\an8}You should give your weapon
some care now and then!

97
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,598
I pity your axe!

98
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,602
You probably think
I'm being annoying, don't you?

99
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,561
No.

100
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,774
{\an8}When it comes to handling weapons,
I trust you more than anyone else.

101
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,827
Stay back.

102
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,370
What is it?

103
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,579
There's a monster lurking.

104
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,997
Then kill it.

105
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,125
I don't know what or where it is.

106
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,877
Then how can you be certain
there's a monster?

107
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,295
J-Just a feeling.

108
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,463
Are you serious?

109
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,840
Mr. Tansu.

110
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,593
{\an8}You should trust Laios
when he's like this.

111
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,638
I can't afford
to entertain a baseless suspicion.

112
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,266
If it's lurking, simply drag it out.

113
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,574
Oh, I see.

114
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,409
It's a Tentacles.

115
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,202
This isn't the time to admire it!

116
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,746
Kiki! Hang in there!

117
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,123
Hey, don't just stand there!

118
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,000
Defeat the monster already!

119
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,626
Our weapons can't reach it.

120
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,378
Hurry up and do something!

121
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,840
What if we purposefully let ourselves
get caught to get up close?

122
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,134
Tentacles is part of the cnidarian family.

123
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,428
<i>If their feelers
make contact with your skin,</i>

124
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,638
<i>they shoot out venomous spines
that paralyze you.</i>

125
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,142
If we get caught, there's a good chance
we won't make it out alive.

126
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,269
Even if you die, I'll resurrect you!

127
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,270
Listen...

128
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,314
Fine. I'll go.

129
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,775
Senshi, let me borrow your helmet.

130
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,281
Laios, you shouldn't do this!

131
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,242
You shouldn't count
on the success rate of resurrection magic.

132
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,494
It's going to be okay.

133
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,372
Because you and Senshi
are who I'm counting on.

134
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,044
-Huh? What did he mean by that?
-I don't know.

135
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,128
All right.

136
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,380
Hey! Over here, Tentacles!

137
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,802
Ow!

138
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,305
They're piercing me through my armor,
just as I feared.

139
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,808
My arms are already going numb.

140
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,185
But...

141
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,312
What on earth are you doing, Laios?

142
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,522
Target its midsection!

143
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,439
Its midsection!

144
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,619
{\an8}Dammit.

145
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,703
{\an8}<i>So that's what he meant!</i>

146
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,998
<i>He gave me the trickiest task!</i>

147
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,048
Kiki!

148
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,597
Laios, are you okay?

149
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,394
I guess not.

150
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,816
Wait, what?

151
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,360
Oh, Kiki. What happened to you?

152
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,279
I'll heal you right away.

153
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,449
This is going to be a little tricky.

154
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,035
Sorry, this might take a while.

155
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,412
Take your time.

156
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,040
Is it just me,
or does your face look different?

157
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,042
I got stung by a Tentacles.

158
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,962
What should I do about this?

159
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,047
Why are you grasping that?

160
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,217
When I tore it off, my hand went numb,
and now I can't let go.

161
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,636
Your hand looks like a gnome's now.

162
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,971
Let me see.

163
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,515
Ivy Tentacles, huh?

164
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,727
"Rinsing it with vinegar can reduce
some of the stingers' activity."

165
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,439
"It can have the opposite effect
depending on the species of Tentacles,

166
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,481
so proceed with caution."

167
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,485
"Make a cross-shaped incision
in the cross-section and peel vertically

168
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,863
to remove the outer layer
with the stingers."

169
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,867
TENTACLES WITH VINEGAR DRESSING

170
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,785
Apparently, it tastes pretty good.

171
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,911
Are you joking?

172
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,497
No, it's just a fun fact...

173
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,250
If that's the only way,
then I have no other choice.

174
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,501
What?

175
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,463
I see. It's not bad.

176
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,215
If prepared right,
it'll be even more delicious.

177
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,634
Let me have a bite, too!

178
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,887
This...

179
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,681
tastes different depending on the part!

180
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,391
You're definitely imagining it.

181
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,101
No, it's true!

182
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,144
Try it.

183
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,899
It only tastes like vinegar.

184
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,193
Do you want a bite, too, Marcille?

185
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,861
Huh? What is it?

186
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,198
It tastes sour.

187
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,241
It's kinda gooey.

188
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,662
-It's taro root. Tell me it's taro root.
-You, too, Namari.

189
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,081
This part. I recommend this part.

190
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,707
No! No, thanks!

191
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,418
We're not lacking food!

192
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,295
It tastes good, though.

193
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,173
Not quite,
but it could be if prepared right.

194
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,967
Either stew it or mash it and then fry it.

195
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,427
Sounds good!

196
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,347
It slipped off!

197
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,310
Sorry for the wait.

198
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,895
I'll treat you now.

199
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,313
Thank you.

200
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,941
Well then, please heal her first.

201
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:41,450
<i>Ilava Rietge Atheus Pilitos
Nuswera Iboiseme Seus Wehrba.</i>

202
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,666
{\an8}It feels awesome being in good health!

203
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,044
Thank you, Mr. Tansu.

204
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:52,962
You, too, Laios.

205
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,339
{\an8}What's with your face?

206
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,841
{\an8}Thank Namari instead.

207
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,758
{\an8}What?

208
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,053
Your marksmanship was truly remarkable.

209
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,264
It's amazing you took it down
with just one shot.

210
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,559
We're lucky you're skilled
with a crossbow, too.

211
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,603
Actually, it was my first time using one.

212
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,521
What?

213
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,189
Namari.

214
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,861
Thanks for giving us a hand.

215
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,863
I'll set aside the incident
with Falin for now.

216
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,198
{\an8}You're most welcome.

217
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:25,995
{\an8}Getting paid makes you give it your best,
more so than doing it for free.

218
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,375
Now, now, you two.

219
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,918
It's all in the past now.

220
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,545
It totally isn't!

221
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,299
Why are you, of all people,
acting like it's none of your business?

222
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,675
Unbelievable!

223
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,886
-That's not what I meant!
-Are you the leader?

224
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,471
Tough role, huh?

225
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,267
It's looking this way.

226
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,936
Is it still upset?

227
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,648
What did you do
to make the spirit so furious?

228
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,067
I've never been attacked by one
so fiercely before.

229
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,613
{\an8}I may have accidentally poured
boiling water directly onto it.

230
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,782
That's not good. Typical of an elf.

231
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,451
Elves...

232
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,828
My race has nothing to do with it!

233
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:12,208
Is there a way to pacify the spirit
without using magic?

234
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,584
That's simple.

235
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,962
<i>An Undine is a collective of tiny spirits.</i>

236
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,257
<i>If the individuals comprising it
naturally dies off,</i>

237
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,344
<i>their hostility will fade away
as new generations emerge.</i>

238
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:27,515
The lifespan of a spirit
is a week at most.

239
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,350
A week?

240
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,769
I can't wait that long.

241
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,354
Neither can we.

242
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,982
So, we will return to the surface for now.

243
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,818
We'll resume our investigation
another time.

244
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,446
Hey, let's prepare the return spell.

245
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,367
Hey, Laios.
They're preparing the return spell.

246
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,954
Mr. Tansu, I have a favor to ask you.

247
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,500
You want me to return
to the surface with them?

248
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,794
Now? After coming all this way?

249
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,129
You're currently out of magic.

250
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,258
I've heard that running out of magic
is similar to having anemia.

251
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,177
You should head back to the surface
with Mr. Tansu's party.

252
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,428
I'm fine.

253
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,514
I'm actually quite surprised
by how great I feel.

254
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,224
Oh, I think it might be due to the liver.

255
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,394
Eating nutritious food won't result
in immediate changes to your condition.

256
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,354
-It's one's daily...
-I'll listen to that later.

257
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,815
I really feel fantastic.

258
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,442
I think some of my magic returned as well
after a short rest.

259
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,281
But your staff doesn't seem
to have the usual magical aura.

260
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,575
T-That's because...

261
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,537
Let's leave her.

262
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,123
Why are you laughing?

263
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,543
It's just that I've never seen you
with that expression before.

264
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,044
But...

265
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,463
what are you going to do
when you're on your own?

266
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,258
The three of you
can't fight a dragon by yourselves.

267
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,051
Don't count me in.

268
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:51,765
Plus, that axe of yours doesn't seem like
it could harm a dragon in the slightest.

269
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,313
Namari, you've defeated
many dragons, right?

270
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,189
Yeah.

271
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,692
Well then...

272
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,446
Please, Namari.

273
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,072
Rejoin our party!

274
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,949
{\an8}Are you serious?

275
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,578
Help Laios' party defeat the Red Dragon.

276
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,039
I want to rescue Falin, no matter what!

277
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,916
Just this once!

278
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,043
I'll find a way to gather the funds!

279
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,753
Forget it, Marcille.

280
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,588
Why?

281
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,049
The adventurer community is small.

282
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,760
Gossip travels like wildfire.

283
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,347
Namari has been having
financial problems for some time now.

284
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,433
And you got wind of it,
didn't you, Mr. Tansu?

285
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,392
I did.

286
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,979
Now, imagine if she rejoined
her former party for money.

287
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,232
<i>"She'll do anything for the right price."</i>

288
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,860
<i>That's what people will say about her.</i>

289
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,238
<i>It may open up more job opportunities,</i>

290
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,491
<i>but it'd probably attract
a different clientele.</i>

291
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,409
So, forget it.

292
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,870
Especially if you care
about both your futures.

293
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,706
That's how it is.

294
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,500
Forget it, Marcille.

295
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,761
{\an8}No. There's still another way.

296
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,514
{\an8}There's another way for me
to regain my magic.

297
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,516
W-What is it?

298
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,393
I drink...

299
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,269
{\an8}the Undine!

300
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,731
What? The Undine?

301
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,234
What's with your reactions?

302
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,902
Where's your usual enthusiasm?

303
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,904
I'm not so interested in spirits.

304
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,865
Spirits live on magic.

305
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,910
I'm certain they're abundant
in magical energy!

306
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:39,081
<i>Capturing it seems trickier
than defeating it, though.</i>

307
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:44,086
But water spirits are vulnerable to heat,
so maybe I can use that.

308
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,755
{\an8}Maybe we can attack it
with a heated weapon.

309
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,885
{\an8}Or maybe we can pour oil on the lake,
set it on fire, and trap the spirit?

310
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,432
{\an8}When it attacks, it spills on the ground,

311
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,100
{\an8}and maybe I could quickly drink that.

312
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,479
{\an8}It'd probably poke holes
in your body from the inside.

313
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,731
{\an8}You're right.

314
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,358
{\an8}Come on, think.

315
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,484
{\an8}There must be a way.

316
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,283
By heating this pot
and using it as a shield,

317
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,993
I could defend and attack simultaneously.

318
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,579
{\an8}Undines are powerful enough
to penetrate a stone column, though.

319
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,622
{\an8}You think that shabby pot can protect you?

320
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,125
It's unfair to call it a shabby pot.

321
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,754
It's a family heirloom that's been
passed down through generations.

322
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,131
I have diligently maintained it.

323
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,051
It never gets burnt
and it distributes heat evenly.

324
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,635
It's an exceptional pot.

325
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,387
Hold on.

326
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,141
The color, the sheen,

327
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,311
the weight, the texture...

328
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,396
This is adamant!

329
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,856
Unbelievable.

330
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,900
As a weapon,
it can shatter a dragon's bone.

331
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,943
As armor,
it shields even against a dragon's fangs.

332
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,406
Adamant, the metal
that every blacksmith dreams of.

333
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,408
So, why is it used for a pot?

334
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,079
It was originally a shield,
but I had no need for it, so...

335
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,039
How can you be so wasteful?!

336
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,291
{\an8}Do you think it could withstand
an Undine's assault?

337
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,584
{\an8}Of course, it could!

338
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,961
We happen to have both a pot and a lid,

339
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,714
so two of us can wield one each
to attack it from both sides...

340
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,801
And we'll burn it with fire!

341
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,594
It's the only option we have.

342
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:17,846
<i>Really?</i>

343
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,933
<i>Even if they have tough shields,
the Undine is so powerful.</i>

344
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,646
<i>Maybe the dwarf could restrain it,
but is Laios strong enough?</i>

345
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,861
Brace yourself as soon
as the surface starts to warp.

346
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,323
Let's not waste this opportunity.

347
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,953
Here comes!

348
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,914
Laios!

349
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,674
<i>What incredible power!</i>

350
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,683
Laios!

351
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,570
Namari...

352
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,791
{\an8}Now!

353
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,801
Good. Keep going.

354
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,428
Hang in there!

355
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,305
Place it over the flames!

356
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,079
So hot!

357
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,498
-Wow, this is amazing!
-Incredible.

358
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,459
What astounding strength!

359
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,004
Namari, Senshi, thank you so much!

360
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,714
You, too, Laios.

361
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,299
Are you okay?

362
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,635
Despite his physique, he's pretty flimsy.

363
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,261
Just like a typical tall-man.

364
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,846
Right.

365
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,565
No need to drink it all in one go.

366
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,027
Spirit magic is hard to absorb.

367
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:42,783
It's fundamental to pair nutrition
with something that aids in absorption.

368
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,534
Senshi.

369
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,995
Let's start cooking.

370
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,918
<i>Peel the potatoes, carrots,
onions, and the Tentacles.</i>

371
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,003
<i>Then cut them into bite-sized pieces.</i>

372
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,548
<i>Marinate the Kelpie meat
with salt and pepper,</i>

373
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,759
<i>and fry until the surface changes color.</i>

374
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,553
<i>Add the onions and carrots
and sauté them together,</i>

375
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,597
<i>then put them into the Undine.</i>

376
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,309
<i>Skim well,</i>

377
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>then add the potatoes
and spices and simmer.</i>

378
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,781
It's done!

379
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,325
UNDINE STEW WITH TENTACLES AND KELPIE

380
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,244
Huh? Where did everyone go?

381
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,205
They went to continue their investigation
at the tower across the water.

382
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,416
{\an8}We're back!

383
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,835
{\an8}I had no idea there would be so many.

384
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,045
{\an8}Good thing we dealt with them.

385
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,089
{\an8}H-Hey!

386
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,093
Would you like to join us for a meal?

387
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,057
Here you go.

388
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,226
Looks good.

389
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,270
Did you make this, Marcille?

390
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,981
Senshi helped a lot.

391
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,400
Here, Namari.

392
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,155
You should start eating
instead of serving everyone.

393
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,740
O-Okay.

394
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,004
Yes!

395
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,131
Some magic is starting to come back.

396
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,216
You guys,

397
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,054
did you come this far
while scavenging all this time?

398
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,388
Yup.

399
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,434
<i>I was ready to face criticism
for leaving the party,</i>

400
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,562
<i>but I never expected
to see them resort to this.</i>

401
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,149
<i>Maybe this is a form of punishment.</i>

402
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,533
<i>It's delicious! The broth
has been infused into the ingredients.</i>

403
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,702
<i>How did everything cook so quickly?</i>

404
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,037
<i>Is it because of the pot?</i>

405
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,623
<i>Could adamant
be a good material for making pots?</i>

406
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,250
Senshi, was it?

407
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,253
Um, about your axe...

408
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,380
I apologize for making fun of it.

409
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,133
It's all right.

410
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,262
The truth is, I have no interest
in any blacksmithing work.

411
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,724
I can't distinguish
different types of ore,

412
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,436
and my old friends
used to get frustrated with me often.

413
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,982
Namari, we're heading back to the surface.

414
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,945
{\an8}But you can stay here.

415
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,448
{\an8}What are you talking about?

416
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,742
Try a bite at least!

417
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,203
The texture is a bit odd,
but it tastes quite good!

418
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,371
{\an8}But...

419
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,165
{\an8}I know I can't ask you to trust me...

420
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,752
but I want to be more
than just a hired hand.

421
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,421
I want to be accepted as one of you.

422
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,049
I'll work hard.

423
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,438
Frankly, Chilchuck,

424
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,108
I thought you'd be the first one
to leave the party.

425
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,486
You're not the kind to accept unpaid work.

426
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,904
Damn right.

427
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,490
That's why I always insist
on getting paid upfront.

428
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,744
But the problem is that I can't walk away
when situations like this arise.

429
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,372
{\an8}What? You stayed because it was your job?

430
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,583
{\an8}Not for your friends or friendship?

431
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,626
{\an8}Listen, Marcille.

432
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,628
{\an8}Let me tell you something important.

433
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,506
Folks who claim
they don't need anything in return

434
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,426
are the least trustworthy in this world.

435
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,762
By the way, what's Shuro up to now?

436
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,431
No idea.

437
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,516
He seemed to have
another contact to reach out to.

438
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,561
But he was so in love with Falin
that he wanted to propose to her.

439
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,022
So, he's probably still
desperately searching for her.

440
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,816
What? I had no clue.

441
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,526
-He's so oblivious.
-Totally.

442
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,528
Look, I get that you guys

443
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:54,159
{\an8}all care about Falin, but be sure
to make it back to the surface, okay?

444
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,455
Namari, you take care, too.

445
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,589
See ya!

446
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,975
