ORIGINAL WORK BY RYOKO KUI

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,975
<i>It all started in a small village.</i>

3
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>One day, a rumble in the ground
caused a rift under the cemetery,</i>

4
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,567
<i>from which a single man appeared.</i>

5
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>He claimed to be the king
of a once prosperous kingdom.</i>

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>He states that the once glorious land</i>

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,828
<i>continues to be held captive
deep underground</i>

8
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,581
<i>by the hands of a mad magician.</i>

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>To whomever defeats this magician,</i>

10
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,753
<i>he offers everything his kingdom has.</i>

11
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>After he imparts these words,
he turns to dust and vanishes.</i>

12
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,975
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

13
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,196
Keep it up, everyone.

14
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,114
We've only got a bit left
after this dragon.

15
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,116
Let's go!

16
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>We're completely prepared.</i>

17
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,120
<i>Nothing can get in our way.</i>

18
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,710
<i>That's not true.</i>

19
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,463
<i>We're hungry.</i>

20
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>Everyone's movements lack
their usual edge.</i>

21
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,056
<i>We lost a day roaming around
due to a misprint on our map.</i>

22
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,351
<i>We walked into a trap
and lost three days' worth of food.</i>

23
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,735
<i>It's bothersome, but we should turn back
for a bit after defeating the dragon.</i>

24
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,945
Laios!

25
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,696
<i>What happened, Falin?</i>

26
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,949
<i>Did they cast a confusion spell on you?</i>

27
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,452
<i>Wh...</i>

28
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>What?</i>

29
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,458
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

30
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,212
<i>We're all dead?
We're so deep in the dungeon.</i>

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,216
R-Run.

32
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,104
Laios.

33
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,568
You're awake.

34
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,156
{\an8}It looks like a magic spell
got us out of the dungeon,

35
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,117
but Falin's the only one we can't find.

36
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,955
She was eaten.

37
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:44,956
What?

38
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,168
Her magic didn't work
from inside the dragon's stomach.

39
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,628
That can't be.

40
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,338
She's probably still in the dungeon.

41
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,923
Let's go now to save her.

42
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,925
Hold on.

43
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:01,806
Honestly, it looks like almost everything
we had was left behind in the dungeon.

44
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,892
So we're basically cleaned out.

45
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,226
What?

46
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,103
And what's worse...

47
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,229
Chilchuck?

48
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,232
We just lost two of our party members.

49
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,317
RESIGNATION LETTER

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,234
What's that?

51
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,322
Apparently another party's
been courting them for a while now.

52
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,740
What?

53
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,743
<i>Exploring dungeons costs money</i>

54
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,747
<i>for hiring companions,
buying equipment, and getting food too.</i>

55
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,209
<i>We can sell our current equipment
and secure what funds we have now</i>

56
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,587
<i>to switch to cheaper equipment.</i>

57
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,258
<i>As well as to pay for food, medicine,
necessities, and new companions.</i>

58
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,761
-Do we have enough?
-Not in the slightest.

59
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,890
{\an8}My little sister will get digested
while we get everything ready.

60
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,227
There's that person who once revived
someone from shreds, right?

61
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,646
Have they ever revived someone from poop?

62
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,482
Never heard of that.

63
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,820
I know we're short on cash,

64
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,614
but how about some food first?

65
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,117
After all, our empty stomachs
may have been why we failed.

66
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,995
What should we eat?

67
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,499
For cheap food, we could go to
the bistro on the main street,

68
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,918
or there's The Laughing Wolf
for bigger meals.

69
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,921
Oh, but that pub's hard to pass up too!

70
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,049
Their soup dumplings are to die for.

71
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,676
-No.
-What?

72
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,345
We need to get back to the dungeon.

73
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,763
But as we are now...

74
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,556
I have an idea.

75
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,810
-You two will leave the party.
-What?

76
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,939
Then, we'll sell your equipment
and I'll enter the dungeon alone.

77
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,357
That's insane.

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,441
Do you have a death wish?

79
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,237
This way, we won't have to compromise
on using quality equipment,

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,699
and I can get to the lowest floor
while avoiding monsters if I'm alone.

81
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,701
It's not impossible.

82
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,953
It's all my fault in the first place.

83
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,747
I can't put you two in danger too.

84
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,544
I'm going too, no matter what.

85
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,838
I'll do anything to save Falin.

86
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,048
Falin is dear to me too.

87
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,635
I won't drag you down.

88
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,555
You know how strong my magic is.

89
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,558
Don't forget about my job, too.

90
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,186
You'll need me to open doors
and disable traps.

91
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,938
You guys...

92
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,194
You really mean to go with me, right?

93
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,196
For better or for worse?

94
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,782
Y-Yeah.

95
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,953
We'll secure food from within the dungeon.

96
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,954
-What?!
-What?!

97
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,749
There are more than enough
monsters in the dungeon.

98
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,960
That means an entire ecosystem
exists inside.

99
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,006
Carnivorous monsters will have
herbivorous monsters to feed on,

100
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,216
and the herbivorous monsters eat plants

101
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,969
that find nutrients
from water, sunlight, and dirt.

102
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:49,223
In other words,
humans can eat in the dungeon too.

103
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,853
So, what you're saying

104
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,855
is that we'll eat monsters?

105
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,815
We'll eat monsters too.

106
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,109
Think about our adventures until now.

107
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,613
I'm sure there were
a lot of tasty-looking things.

108
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,991
No, there's no way I'm eating those.

109
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,369
There are quite a bit of people
who hunt monsters for food.

110
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,664
You mean the criminals
who can't come back on land?

111
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,126
Even they get hospitalized
all the time from food poisoning.

112
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,379
You said you'd do anything to save Falin.

113
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,131
I never said I'd eat monsters.

114
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,218
{\an8}There's no time nor money.
What other choice do we have?

115
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,345
{\an8}But there's no point
if we eat something weird

116
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,722
{\an8}and get stopped by food poisoning.

117
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,767
Run away!

118
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,145
Save us!

119
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,691
Looks like dungeon newbies.

120
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,196
They're not cut out for this
if they can't handle a monster like this.

121
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,199
Hey, Laios?

122
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,952
Let's make lunch out of this.

123
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,829
I refuse!

124
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,581
No, absolutely not!

125
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,709
Isn't going straight to mushrooms
a bit risky?

126
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,589
The dungeon food guide
says it's food suited for beginners.

127
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,425
It's meaty and has a mild taste.

128
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,053
-What is this book?
-It looks pretty worn down.

129
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,348
Let's go find more space
to start a fire.

130
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,892
Wish we had one or two
more ingredients, though.

131
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,189
Those steps are from a Huge Scorpion!

132
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,608
Could it be that he...

133
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,695
<i>Despite being a dungeon,
many people come and go,</i>

134
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,197
<i>making it a bustling place
for adventurers and merchants.</i>

135
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,283
{\an8}<i>A former cemetery,</i>

136
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,369
{\an8}<i>it was once a sacred place
where villagers slept in peace.</i>

137
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,747
<i>But once it was connected to
the dungeon six years ago,</i>

138
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,834
<i>it became the liveliest place
in the village.</i>

139
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,005
<i>They say monsters emerge
from the depths of the dungeon.</i>

140
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>It is unclear whether a forbidden spell
transformed terrestrial creatures</i>

141
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,512
<i>or if they were summoned
from the world of monsters.</i>

142
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,432
<i>But they all have an odd appearance</i>

143
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,351
<i>and attack humans as if
they have something to protect.</i>

144
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,147
<i>But that served as the only proof we have</i>

145
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,525
<i>that the cursed,
formerly prosperous capital truly exists.</i>

146
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,070
Don't kill it like a crayfish.

147
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,616
This is how you catch it,
so it's easier than a crayfish.

148
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,783
Hey.

149
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:18,080
You've been looking for a chance
to eat monsters for a while, haven't you?

150
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,211
But that doesn't change the fact
that I want to save my sister.

151
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,670
Yeah, okay.

152
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,299
I've never told you this,
but I love monsters.

153
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,677
from their appearance and cries
to their ecology.

154
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,096
I soon wanted to know their taste.

155
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,264
He's a psychopath.

156
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,273
Shouldn't we do this
where there are fewer people?

157
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,568
It's hard to go back and forth for water.

158
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,988
So, how do we eat these?

159
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,074
Let's try an orthodox approach.

160
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,327
What's wrong?

161
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,830
It's easy to cut from above,
but there's resistance from the side.

162
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,041
When we fight against
mushroom-type monsters,

163
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,919
slashing diagonally or horizontally
might be less effective.

164
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,837
That's good to know.

165
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,799
It looks like food if you slice it up.

166
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:10,716
I don't see it.

167
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,845
Hey, hold on!

168
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,391
We're eating it as is?
What about the venom?

169
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,018
This scorpion's venom is safe to eat.

170
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,646
Really?

171
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,232
That's what the book said,
so I want to try it.

172
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,485
Blech.

173
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,696
Told you.

174
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,863
Hold it right there.

175
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,908
Scorpion Hot Pot, eh?

176
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,869
But that method leaves much to be desired.

177
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,079
Who are you?

178
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,540
When you eat this monster,

179
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,877
you must cut off
the pincers, head, and legs.

180
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,380
The tail will upset your stomach.

181
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,341
The book said it'd be fine.

182
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,385
Or rather it just tastes bad.

183
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,138
Also, cut up the body as well.

184
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:01,392
It'll cook through more easily,
and the juices create a delicious broth.

185
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,394
It's easier to eat too.

186
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,896
And take out the internal organs.

187
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,898
They're bitter and have an awful texture.

188
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,442
As for the Walking Mushroom,

189
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,486
throw out the bottom
and three centimeters from the surface.

190
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,530
The feet are tasty, so keep those.

191
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,407
The feet are tasty?

192
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,619
Yeah, they have
a nice, unique smell, right?

193
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,287
<i>The smell of the feet, huh?</i>

194
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,539
This pot is too small.

195
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,499
Let's use mine.

196
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,044
You sure are prepared.

197
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,881
It feels like it's missing something.

198
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,596
Here.

199
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,514
Wait, there's no way I'll eat that.

200
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,309
-Marcille?
-Not in a million years.

201
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,935
This is a cemetery, you know.

202
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,937
Even if I'm okay with monsters,

203
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,190
plants with roots are out of the question.

204
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,651
Doesn't it look
good enough with just this?

205
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,861
-Marcille!
-And who the hell are you?

206
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,488
-Look up!
-What?

207
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,411
A Slime!

208
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,914
<i>Dammit, it's covering my face.</i>

209
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,917
<i>Oh no, I can't cast any spells.</i>

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,921
<i>Thinking back,
my first death was to a Slime.</i>

211
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,012
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

212
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,639
It got in my nose, though.

213
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,057
Blow it out.

214
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,268
You got rid of a Slime with just a knife?

215
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,813
It's simple if you know its composition.

216
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,107
They may look amorphous,

217
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,901
but their composition is actually
more structured than humans.

218
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,780
This is the inside of a Slime.

219
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,408
Compared to humans,
the stomach is flipped

220
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,078
and covers its internal organs and head
with digestive fluids.

221
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,957
It senses the breathing of its prey
and springs into action.

222
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,711
So you're an easier target
if you shout in a loud voice.

223
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,256
It's not edible like this,

224
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,051
but you can add citrus juice,
and wash it thoroughly in hot water.

225
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,761
Then, wipe off the moisture

226
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,473
or rub it in salt and dry it in the sun.

227
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,475
This makes a delicious delicacy.

228
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,020
If possible, it's best to
let it fast for two weeks.

229
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,481
Drying it takes time too.

230
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,985
This is a portable Slime drying net
that I made myself.

231
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,987
Sandwich it like this

232
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,531
and it dries as you walk around.

233
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,200
It takes time until it's ready,

234
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,619
but here's the final product.

235
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,122
Let's add this for today.

236
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,500
-But isn't it a delicacy?
-It's fine.

237
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,714
I've researched monster food
in this dungeon for over ten years.

238
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,260
Nothing makes me happier than to hear
someone is interested in Monster cuisine.

239
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,636
Ten years?

240
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,264
Was the dungeon here that long?

241
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,516
Well, sit tight.

242
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,495
{\an8}It's ready.

243
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,288
{\an8}HUGE SCORPION
AND WALKING MUSHROOM HOT POT

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,628
Boiled Huge Scorpions turn red, huh?

245
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,088
It feels so different seeing it in person.

246
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,175
It smells kind of delicious.

247
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,011
The meat contracts when cooked,

248
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,804
so it comes apart easily.

249
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,806
You're right.

250
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,810
This is delicious!

251
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,938
Isn't it?

252
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,315
It tastes so different
based on how you cook it.

253
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,359
Right?

254
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,319
It's so good! I'm shocked!

255
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,321
Right?!

256
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,576
Give me some too.

257
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,704
What is this?

258
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,040
Dried Slime innards.

259
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,336
It's good!

260
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,464
So, this is how you eat Slimes?

261
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,384
It also tastes good soaked in fruit juice.

262
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,428
And these tree roots
are so nice and fluffy.

263
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,264
They're not technically roots.

264
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,600
They're tree trunks
that grow upside down in the dungeon.

265
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,103
This algae is so soft and tasty.

266
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,814
Does this grow in the dungeon too?

267
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,234
That's just normal algae
that grows in humid places.

268
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,238
I can't believe all this is from
the dungeon we've been walking through.

269
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,120
I'm stuffed.

270
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,830
We still haven't heard your name.

271
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,416
My name is Senshi.

272
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,835
It means "researcher" in Dwarvish.

273
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,837
I'm Laios.

274
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,756
That's Marcille the magic-user
and Chilchuck the picklock.

275
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,843
Looks like you're on a mission.

276
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,386
Yes, that's right.

277
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,599
{\an8}One of our companions got eaten
by a monster in the lower levels.

278
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,268
{\an8}We want to save her
before she gets digested.

279
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,147
By a monster? What kind?

280
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,982
A dragon with deep-red scales.

281
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,110
Deep-red scales?

282
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,154
The Red Dragon?

283
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,865
<i>To maintain their large bodies,</i>

284
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,783
<i>dragons spend most of their days sleeping.</i>

285
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,912
They also digest
much more slowly than other monsters.

286
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,164
I hope so.

287
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,665
Please.

288
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,793
Would you allow me to accompany you?

289
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,670
You're more than welcome to.

290
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,173
It'd be a huge help to us as well.

291
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,675
Really?

292
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,428
-Thank you.
-Likewise.

293
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,432
I've dreamt of cooking
the Red Dragon for many years.

294
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,476
The Red Dragon.

295
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,688
Maybe I should go for the traditional
steak, or perhaps a burger.

296
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,941
Shabu-shabu is great too.

297
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,444
No, if I have eggs,
a Dragon and Egg bowl would be good.

298
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,200
<i>Is it okay to eat that?</i>

299
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,497
<i>It was on everyone's mind,
but no one said a word.</i>

300
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,961
<i>Second basement floor.</i>

301
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,464
<i>Unlike the cemetery
on the first basement floor,</i>

302
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,467
<i>an abnormal view spreads out before them.</i>

303
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,302
<i>According to academics,</i>

304
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,974
<i>this is the spire of the Golden Castle,
which is located deep underground.</i>

305
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,685
I've always wondered about this,

306
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,980
but how do those trees
not go above ground at this height?

307
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,565
Well, a curse made this dungeon.

308
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,486
Marcille, are you okay?

309
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,447
I tripped on a gap in the bridge.

310
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,991
We've walked quite a way.

311
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,575
You must be tired.

312
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,662
Let's find a campsite
and stop early for today.

313
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,625
We spent a night
in a hollow tree here before, didn't we?

314
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,751
Yeah, we did.

315
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,255
I burned myself trying to make pork soup.

316
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,173
Soup...

317
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,883
Are you hungry?

318
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,012
I have some scorpion broth
from lunch today.

319
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,263
I don't want it.

320
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,931
Well, then.

321
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,017
Let's go hunt a monster for dinner.

322
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,019
Jeez.

323
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,147
-What're you in the mood for?
-What?

324
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,275
I'll do my best to match your request.

325
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,152
You say that, but...

326
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,197
We're eating monsters, right?

327
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,161
Ugh, I'm fine with anything
as long as it's edible.

328
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,039
What kind of monsters live around here?

329
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,041
Let's see...

330
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,543
Big Bats and Giant Rats.

331
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,670
I don't want anything unsanitary.

332
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,671
Forest Goblins.

333
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,298
Demi-humans are a no-go.

334
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,424
Living Armor.

335
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,468
Metal?

336
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,305
Isn't there anything more normal,
like birds or tree fruits?

337
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,931
There's always that one person

338
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,977
who shoots down every idea
after agreeing to eat anything.

339
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,313
I don't think I'm asking for much.

340
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,566
There are normal monsters,
but those don't attack humans,

341
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,318
so they'll require more preparation.

342
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,030
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

343
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,074
Sorry, that's true.

344
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,200
But you know,

345
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,661
we might run into a monster
holding a flesh-eating lunch.

346
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,081
Let's try to enjoy this!

347
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,458
Not very optimistic about this.

348
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,462
Well, there are lots of fruits
during this season.

349
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,464
Really?

350
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,466
Yeah.

351
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,472
See? I knew it'd be tree fruit
from Man-eating Plants.

352
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,516
Marcille, that's incorrect.

353
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,476
Man-eating Plants
are just the common name.

354
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,979
That flower, for example, is a Baraselia.

355
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,482
It mainly grows on monster trails

356
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,609
shooting out a mucus
reminiscent of spider webs.

357
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,237
When a creature touches the mucus,
it reflexively pulls them in.

358
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,741
It wraps around things that move,
but it doesn't digest them.

359
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,702
It makes them into compost.

360
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,747
But it sometimes
uses humans for nutrients, right?

361
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,458
The vegetables you usually eat

362
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,129
can be traced back to
dead remains and animal dung.

363
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,756
I can't fault that logic, but...

364
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,133
{\an8}It's fine.

365
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,968
{\an8}It's still only the second basement floor.

366
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,680
{\an8}Someone would notice
if a corpse rolled by here.

367
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,225
{\an8}They have people to retrieve corpses,

368
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,228
{\an8}and no one would get eaten
by a monster in a place like this.

369
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,397
You think so?

370
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,732
I don't think we can pluck them in secret.

371
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,652
We'll have to fight.

372
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,613
Move over.

373
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,950
I'll get rid of them in one shot.

374
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,453
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

375
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,415
<i>Alamandras Proju.</i>

376
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,542
<i>Nexant Aslam.</i>

377
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,169
Stop, you moron!

378
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,837
{\an8}Why?

379
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,719
Do you want the fruit
to get hit by your magic too?

380
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,222
Only take as much as you'll eat.
This rule is absolute.

381
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,600
This isn't the time for that!

382
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,477
No, let go of me!

383
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,693
They can't digest people?

384
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,612
But they're totally eating them!

385
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,698
What? Some of them
can digest things, though.

386
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,241
Depends on the plant type.

387
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,952
The one that has a hold of you

388
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,246
is a parasite type
that plants seeds inside your skin.

389
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,123
That's the worst kind!

390
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,751
Try to stay still, Marcille.

391
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,838
Plant-based monsters
basically have several limbs.

392
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,132
It'll take forever to fight them
one at a time.

393
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,551
For swords, there's only
one sure-fire spot.

394
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,511
The root.

395
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,892
Ouch...

396
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,727
Are you okay?

397
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,896
Yeah, thanks Laios.

398
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,273
-How was it?
-What?

399
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,194
This is Shadowtail, a plant-based parasite
that buries seeds

400
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,779
inside the skin of living creatures.

401
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,908
Unlike the Baraselia,
which is strong enough to break bones,

402
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,869
the Shadowtail needs to capture
its prey without killing them.

403
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,288
It uses a delicate balance,

404
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,292
immobilizing its prey
without making it uncomfortable.

405
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,796
I feel like it'd feel really good.
How did you feel?

406
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,925
I made her mad again.

407
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,803
Even I thought you were a bit much.

408
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,941
First, steam it lightly.

409
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,944
Cut around the stem in a circle.

410
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,282
Twist it a bit
and pull to get the seeds out.

411
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,701
-Wow.
-Peel the skin off,

412
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,203
beat the skin to make it soft,

413
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,956
and cover the pan with it.

414
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,295
Grind up the unripe fruit,
adding Slime and some scorpion broth,

415
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,463
mixing until it thickens.

416
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,675
Once it gets smooth,
add the rest of the scorpion broth

417
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,386
and chunks of tree fruit.

418
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,472
Mix it a bit
and pour it into the frying pan.

419
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,349
Cook it a bit.

420
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,727
I want to see if we can grow it
on the surface.

421
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,228
Of course, we can't.

422
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,813
No!

423
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,735
When it starts bubbling,
add the rest of the fruit.

424
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,237
All right.

425
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,114
It's done.

426
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,241
MAN-EATING PLANTS FRUIT TART

427
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,659
A tart?

428
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,244
At least, it looks like it.

429
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,289
The crust is just a non-stick coating.
You can leave it.

430
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,460
It's salt-flavored.
That's not what I expected.

431
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,003
Yeah, it's good.

432
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,965
Try it, Marcille. You'll probably like it.

433
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,677
None of the plants that ate people
are in it, right?

434
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:30,098
No, if we used
the gelatin from those plants,

435
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,726
it would've turned out even better.

436
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,770
The Slime didn't solidify well.

437
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,278
This is delicious.

438
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,114
The compost-type plants' fruit
is fresh and sweet.

439
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,283
The digestion-type plants'
is more compact and rich.

440
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,744
But I wonder if that's okay.

441
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,789
Doesn't that mean
they get eaten by other animals?

442
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,708
All this fruit they make gets taken away.

443
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,461
That's how a carnivorous plant works.

444
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,464
They use them to capture prey
for nourishment.

445
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,673
Oh, I see.

446
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,427
I wonder if this sweetness
is one of their tricks then.

447
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,513
Now I get it.

448
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,018
I'm so happy you're getting interested.

449
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,186
Stop that!

450
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,404
What'll we do with that corpse?

451
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,698
We don't have time
to go back to town.

452
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,451
Want me to revive it with magic?

453
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,663
No, there's a chance it won't work.

454
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,000
Maybe someone will take it
if we leave it in the open.

455
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,210
Yeah.

456
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,088
Let's make it visible.

457
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,217
I've seen this at execution sites.

458
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,557
<i>Marcille had a nightmare that night.</i>

459
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,643
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

460
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,562
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

461
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,398
<i>There is no hierarchy.</i>

462
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,818
<i>Eating is a privilege for those who live.</i>

463
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,987
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

464
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,489
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

465
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,911
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

466
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,998
