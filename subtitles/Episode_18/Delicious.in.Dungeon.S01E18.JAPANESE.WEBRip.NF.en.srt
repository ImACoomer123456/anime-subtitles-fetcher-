1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,440
We had such a tough time
finding those stairs up,

3
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,276
but as soon as we decide
to move forward, we find this.

4
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,778
It makes me feel queasy.

5
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,780
It's still wet.

6
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,826
Falin must've passed through here
not too long ago and made her way down.

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,745
It must've been a tight squeeze.

8
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,289
<i>The sixth floor</i>

9
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,460
<i>consists of canals
made from tunnels dug by ancient dwarves.</i>

10
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,879
<i>Endlessly vast and long,</i>

11
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,216
<i>they crisscross under the city like veins.</i>

12
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,554
<i>Many things must have flowed
through here over the years.</i>

13
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>Water, of course,
but also people, animals,</i>

14
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,518
<i>conspiracies, lies, and rumors.</i>

15
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>Money and blood.</i>

16
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,480
I-It's chilly!

17
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,733
The sixth floor is
supposed to be hot and humid.

18
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,486
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

19
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,239
No, I recognize this route.

20
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,909
<i>This is definitely the floor
where the Red Dragon attacked us</i>

21
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,244
<i>and almost wiped us out.</i>

22
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,039
The walls and paths
shift around in this dungeon.

23
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,250
So it's not surprising
if the temperature changes, too.

24
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,128
Better cold than hot,

25
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,756
but it's hard to follow the blood trail
under all this snow and water.

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,635
Why don't we head back
to where we got nearly wiped out?

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
If the Cleaners
haven't gotten to them yet,

28
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,764
maybe we can retrieve
the stuff we left behind.

29
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,017
I hope Falin's okay.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,853
This cold must be rough for a Red Dragon.

31
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,022
Oh, is that why she had feathers?

32
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,356
So what's the plan?

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,941
After bluffing and telling Shuro

34
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,360
that you're going
to take down the lunatic magician,

35
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,529
you do have something in mind, right?

36
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,406
About that...

37
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,743
<i>Falin was looking
for someone named Delgal.</i>

38
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,830
<i>It was an order given to the Red Dragon
by the lunatic magician.</i>

39
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:31,753
<i>That's also why the Dragon was
sleeplessly roaming on a different floor.</i>

40
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,047
Delgal?

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,632
Who was that again?

42
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,091
The name sounds familiar.

43
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,009
He was a king.

44
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,513
Delgal was the last king
of the Golden City

45
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,932
that fell a millennium ago.

46
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,728
<i>There are inscriptions praising him
all over this dungeon.</i>

47
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>That's it!</i>

48
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,981
<i>His name is on excavated stuff as well.</i>

49
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,191
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,901
Didn't Delgal...

51
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,985
Yeah.

52
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,363
<i>When this dungeon was discovered,</i>

53
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,991
<i>he appeared on the surface,
turned to dust, and disappeared.</i>

54
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,202
So, this lunatic magician

55
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,956
has been commanding a Red Dragon
and reconstructing the dungeon,

56
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,208
all to find a king who vanished ages ago?

57
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,003
The lunatic magician saw the previous king
get killed before his eyes.

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,131
Since then, he's been afraid Delgal,
the king's son, will meet the same fate.

59
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,885
{\an8}That's why he thought
we were assassins and attacked us.

60
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,013
{\an8}Huh? Who told you that?

61
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,014
{\an8}Did you make that up?

62
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,267
No, actually,

63
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,020
<i>I bumped into the lunatic magician
in those Living Paintings.</i>

64
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,105
<i>That's how I found out.</i>

65
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,149
Remember when I mentioned
someone getting mad at me

66
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,943
after I had some food in those paintings?

67
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,486
You what?!

68
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,737
You should've said sooner!

69
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,739
I didn't recognize him at the time!

70
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,033
I see.

71
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,868
So you relived the past.

72
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,206
Just to confirm,
the lunatic magician is an elf, right?

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,625
Can elves really live for a millennium?

74
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,586
There are records of that
in the distant past,

75
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,464
but now, elves can only
live up to 500 years at most.

76
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,049
Only, huh?

77
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,760
Well, if he can control
the lives of others at will,

78
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,055
it must be a piece of cake
for him to prolong his own life.

79
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,348
Impossible!

80
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,059
Extending your own lifespan
with your own magic

81
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,062
is like eating yourself to live longer.

82
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,022
Anyway,

83
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,481
if he mistook us as the king's foe,

84
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,066
and attacked us...

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,569
Maybe we can clear up
his misunderstanding by talking to him.

86
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,493
The wind is getting stronger.

87
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,828
It's freezing!

88
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,621
<i>I can't see ahead.</i>

89
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,873
Can you hear me?

90
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,082
Are you guys still with me?!

91
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,584
Where are you, Laios?!

92
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,210
I can't see a thing!

93
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,588
We can't afford to get separated here!

94
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,256
Everyone, hold hands!

95
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,143
<i>We can't go on like this.</i>

96
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,229
There's a tunnel!

97
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,773
Let's take shelter!

98
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,200
Is everyone here?

99
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,201
Chil?

100
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,118
Here.

101
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,036
I'm good.

102
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,621
Marcille?

103
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,747
Uh-huh.

104
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,706
I'm here.

105
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,124
Senshi?

106
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,042
Yeah.

107
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:16,959
I'm fine.

108
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,419
That's a relief.

109
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,337
Huh?

110
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,798
-Marcille, lights, please?
-Hm? What was that?

111
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,266
This place feels like
it used to be a prison.

112
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,103
Anyway, for a moment I was worried that...

113
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,272
-Huh?
-Huh?

114
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,524
-No way!
-No way!

115
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,775
-Huh?
-Huh?

116
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,527
-What's this?
-What's this?

117
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,071
<i>There's more of us!</i>

118
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,657
Dammit! What's going on?

119
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,283
Is this illusion magic?

120
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,910
No.

121
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,290
I think these are Shapeshifters.

122
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,708
Shape-what?

123
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,751
Don't you know them?

124
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,671
They're monsters that pop up
back in my hometown from time to time.

125
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,133
<i>When trekking through the hills
or fields in a thick fog or blizzard,</i>

126
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,469
<i>you suddenly notice your crew
or family have multiplied.</i>

127
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,974
But they're Shapeshifters pretending
to be them and blending in.

128
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,435
Your hometown sounds
like a dangerous place.

129
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,145
Are they a kind of fairy?

130
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,813
Do they work mischief?

131
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,191
If you don't catch on, they'll devour
the original and take their place.

132
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,234
What?!

133
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,194
We have to sniff out the imposters now!

134
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,614
I must eat.

135
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,450
What a pickle.

136
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,202
Say, the Laioses over there...

137
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,455
It's obvious they're imposters.

138
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,873
True.

139
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,959
They don't seem to know
much about monsters.

140
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,920
They say Shapeshifters
can read the minds of creatures

141
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,715
and mimic the looks
of those they're close to.

142
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,383
The three versions of me over there

143
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,928
are probably how I appear
in your memories.

144
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:52,972
True.

145
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,348
If you look carefully,

146
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,393
they all look a little different.

147
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,855
Well then, can you start
by dealing with her?

148
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,772
What?

149
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,191
She's clearly an imposter.

150
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,650
True.

151
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,985
You've got it all wrong!

152
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,361
Take a closer look!

153
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,447
-I'll use magic! Black magic!
-So annoying.

154
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,990
Whose memory is that?

155
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,784
Those two are clearly imposters, too.

156
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,453
How come?

157
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,370
Huh?

158
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,455
Look closely!

159
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,999
My scarf isn't a muffler.

160
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,126
And Senshi's helmet is missing its notch.

161
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,213
Now that you mention it...

162
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,342
Those two must be
straight out of Laios' memories.

163
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,135
His memory of us is too vague.

164
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,932
Is it okay to just leave them?

165
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,893
They aren't as intelligent as humans.

166
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,021
{\an8}But if we hurt them,
they'll put up a fight.

167
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,150
{\an8}And I'd rather not fight
unknown monsters in this situation.

168
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,904
{\an8}Let's unmask these phonies peacefully
and deal with them all at once!

169
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,450
It's great that he's enthusiastic, but...

170
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,870
Can he really spot the imposters?

171
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,413
I'm not too sure.

172
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,917
<i>There are still six imposters left.</i>

173
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,462
<i>When they're all lined up,
the differences are pretty clear.</i>

174
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,216
<i>But even as we do this,
our foggy memories are getting corrected.</i>

175
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>We need to get to the bottom of this fast.</i>

176
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,222
Each Marcille has a different hairstyle.

177
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,350
I can't recall how her hair was
last time I saw her.

178
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,309
-You can't?
-You can't?

179
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,104
This style is pretty unique,
so you must remember!

180
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,021
Come on!

181
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,440
It was freezing in that blizzard,
so I had it down.

182
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,193
The texture of their hair is totally off.

183
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,112
Hair is really important for a mage.

184
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,240
They're all saying stuff
that sounds just like her.

185
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,410
Well, they're the images
we've got of her, after all.

186
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,914
I've got it!

187
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,334
We can tell by asking for information
only the real me would know!

188
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,129
{\an8}Don't go asking them to guess
your mom's maiden name.

189
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,213
{\an8}Not that.

190
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,508
The book of magic!

191
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,219
{\an8}See?

192
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,431
{\an8}One is obviously fake.

193
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,892
But the other two seem legit.

194
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,311
What? Oh, come on!

195
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,062
Her incantation grammar is all messed up!

196
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,480
That's what I was going to say!

197
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,901
Our stuff should help us
spot the fakes a bit.

198
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,820
Senshi, show us your gear.

199
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,452
Take those three away!

200
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,626
<i>We've managed
to narrow it down to two each,</i>

201
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,003
<i>but now we're stuck again.</i>

202
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,049
<i>We've got three more imposters to find.</i>

203
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,511
All right. Let's have a meal.

204
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,388
-In this situation?
-In this situation?

205
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,308
We can't rely on appearances anymore
to spot them.

206
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,144
We'll have to judge
based on their behavior.

207
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,648
Everyone will cook
and I'll be watching closely.

208
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,400
That's how I'll spot the imposters.

209
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,405
<i>He didn't realize
he'd run into the lunatic magician</i>

210
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,157
<i>or pick up on Shuro's feelings.</i>

211
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,702
<i>He couldn't even remember
where he'd met Kabru before.</i>

212
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,164
<i>Are we really relying
on Laios' observation skills here?</i>

213
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,418
<i>-I'm worried.
-I'm worried.</i>

214
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,923
<i>I've got to figure out which
of my companions are monster imposters.</i>

215
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,342
<i>It's a chance to earn back
the trust I've lost.</i>

216
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,469
<i>I don't want to let
my friends down any further.</i>

217
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,098
<i>I must pick up
on those subtle differences!</i>

218
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,308
This is Laios we're talking about.

219
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,813
He might find the monster imposters
more appealing.

220
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,231
-That's possible.
-That's possible.

221
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,567
{\an8}<i>-We've got to do something on our own!
-We've got to do something on our own!</i>

222
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,152
{\an8}I'll be keeping an eye on things.

223
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,154
{\an8}Good luck to you all.

224
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,447
{\an8}So annoying.

225
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,615
{\an8}What are we cooking?

226
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,284
<i>We've got those things
I found on the fifth floor</i>

227
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,496
<i>and those provisions from Lady Maizuru.</i>

228
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,376
<i>We've got the perfect ingredients to make...</i>

229
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,961
And one more thing.

230
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,881
I want each of you to cook a dish
in pairs with your counterpart.

231
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,133
-What?
-What?

232
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,262
I'll be observing the differences
in behavior as you work together.

233
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,556
You can get the recipe from Senshi.

234
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,641
So, everyone,

235
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,393
are you ready?

236
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,103
Start cooking!

237
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,606
<i>First, the Chilchuck team.</i>

238
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,859
<i>Cut the meat.</i>

239
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,986
<i>Mix the egg and seasoning together.</i>

240
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,530
<i>Chilchuck A sat
in the middle of the corridor,</i>

241
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,451
<i>while Chilchuck B sat on top
of a wooden box before getting to work.</i>

242
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:24,952
What are you writing?

243
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,162
You're making this awkward!

244
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,835
This thing won't open.
Laios, give me a hand.

245
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,254
He slipped up!

246
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,256
Did you see that? B's the imposter!

247
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,175
Huh? Why do you say that?

248
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,177
Don't you get it?

249
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,846
I've got my principles
and pride, you know.

250
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,390
People help each other out, Chilchuck.

251
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,059
I think you're being too cynical.

252
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,146
Now that I look closer,
A has a bad look in his eye.

253
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,314
Hey.

254
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,566
Our Chilchuck is cuter than that.

255
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,650
Quit it!

256
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,820
L-Laios, you can tell, can't you?

257
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,072
<i>Chilchuck A...</i>

258
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,451
<i>He does have a mean expression.</i>

259
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,077
<i>Maybe he's the imposter.</i>

260
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,287
I'll think about it.

261
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,830
Keep cooking.

262
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,374
Dolt.

263
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,085
He insulted me in the common language.

264
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,421
<i>Next, the Marcille team.</i>

265
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,799
I know it's a little late to ask,
but what egg is this?

266
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,259
It's a Harpy's egg.

267
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,638
I thought I said at the start,

268
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,473
no humanoid monsters!

269
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,851
I've been making compromises lately,
but this is taking it too far!

270
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>Marcille B is business as usual.</i>

271
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,022
<i>Almost to the point of being extreme.</i>

272
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,106
<i>On the other hand...</i>

273
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,317
<i>Boil the chopped up Dryad.</i>

274
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,237
What do you think, Marcille A?

275
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,988
I'm not thrilled about it,

276
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,325
but I've eaten Fish-man eggs
and even Dryads before.

277
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,993
I wouldn't make a fuss about this now.

278
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,330
I'll do anything to save Falin.

279
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,791
Hey!

280
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,086
I'll do anything for Falin too!

281
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,380
Your determination is a bit lacking, B.

282
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,258
I mean, it's not like
eating a Harpy will fix anything!

283
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,844
<i>Once the Dryad is soft enough
for a chopstick to go through, drain them,</i>

284
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
<i>and mash them up with some seasoning.</i>

285
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,684
<i>Hmm, this is tough.</i>

286
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,811
<i>They both sound like Marcille.</i>

287
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,771
<i>And finally, the Senshi team.</i>

288
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,649
Where did you find the Harpy eggs?

289
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,902
There was a nest in an old, rundown house.

290
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,113
I gathered all I could find there.

291
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,824
<i>Dice the meat into one-centimeter cubes.</i>

292
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,034
After all,

293
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,578
eggs have all the...

294
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,745
...nutrition you need.

295
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,917
<i>Sauté the ingredients with rice
over a low flame and add the seasoning.</i>

296
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,712
Rice was Shuro's favorite.

297
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:44,550
It's packed with nutrients
adventurers need.

298
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,927
We're lucky we got our hands on some.

299
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,639
<i>Unlike me, who's just eager
to try out monsters,</i>

300
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,933
<i>Senshi sees things a step deeper.</i>

301
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,020
<i>I can't match his attention
to flavor and nutrition.</i>

302
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,731
<i>All the dishes look delicious.</i>

303
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,358
<i>I can't spot the imposters
simply based on how efficient they are.</i>

304
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,572
{\an8}Um, nobody's mentioning it,
so I'm going to ask.

305
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,659
Is it just me
or is Senshi B kind of good-looking?

306
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,333
He's always been like that.

307
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,168
Senshi's always been cool.

308
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,085
-Huh?
-Huh?

309
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,922
{\an8}Is this some stereotype about dwarves?

310
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,341
{\an8}Senshi doesn't look this dopey.

311
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,635
<i>Senshi is cool.</i>

312
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,768
The dishes are almost done,
but have you made up your mind yet?

313
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,978
<i>Honestly,</i>

314
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,688
<i>I'm stumped.</i>

315
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,566
<i>They all feel like
they could be both real and fake.</i>

316
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,278
<i>Asking me to spot the illusions
conjured up in our heads</i>

317
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,489
<i>is quite unfair to start with.</i>

318
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,451
<i>Hunting down monsters disguised
as humans might be interesting,</i>

319
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,370
<i>but we're dealing with illusions here.</i>

320
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,457
<i>Hunting down monsters?</i>

321
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,459
It's done!

322
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,378
MEMORIES OF THE FIFTH FLOOR PILAF

323
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,295
SWEET DRYAD

324
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,505
THE WHOLE FIFTH FLOOR PICCATA

325
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,548
All right, everyone,
hear me out as we eat.

326
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,343
The ones I pegged as real are...

327
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,762
Chilchuck A!

328
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,139
<i>The mean one with a bad look in his eyes!</i>

329
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,933
Marcille B!

330
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,269
<i>The one who wouldn't want to eat
a Harpy's egg even if it was for Falin!</i>

331
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,063
And Senshi A!

332
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,272
<i>The one who looks dopey!</i>

333
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,774
So,

334
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,360
please step into the cage, imposters.

335
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,028
-Wait a minute!
-Wait a minute!

336
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,322
Why do you think he's the real deal?

337
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,741
That one's obviously the imposter!

338
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,035
What made you think that?

339
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,371
Just a hunch.

340
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,832
Anyway, I'll explain later.

341
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,167
First, let's get rid of these imposters.

342
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,794
Ju...

343
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,295
Just a hunch?

344
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,839
Get rid of?

345
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,049
As I thought, he can't be counted on.

346
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,093
We have to watch our backs...

347
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,554
On our own.

348
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,893
<i>No matter who I picked,
this was inevitable.</i>

349
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,814
<i>A shapeshifter is a broad term
for monsters that mimic other beings.</i>

350
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,567
<i>Some mimic voices, possess others,</i>

351
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,111
<i>or even physically change forms.</i>

352
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,405
<i>This monster falls into
one of those categories.</i>

353
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,658
<i>There's no way monsters could cook.</i>

354
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,911
<i>They're likely creating illusions,
just as Marcille suggested.</i>

355
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,082
<i>Given that they target humans and animals,
they're probably carnivores or omnivores.</i>

356
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,919
<i>They're timid and lack the strength
to attack their prey head-on.</i>

357
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,173
<i>This place is cold, dark,
and visibility is poor.</i>

358
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,427
<i>They're a beast that can handle the cold
and relies on smell and hearing.</i>

359
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,057
<i>Downwind is that way.</i>

360
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,143
<i>Our enemy's probably
waiting for us to tire out.</i>

361
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,855
<i>Randomly swinging my sword won't cut it.</i>

362
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,899
<i>What should I do?</i>

363
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,860
<i>Kensuke's awfully quiet too.</i>

364
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,820
<i>Maybe it'll die in this cold.</i>

365
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,491
<i>To take down a beast,
you have to fight like one.</i>

366
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,702
<i>I'll turn the tables
and make the hunter the hunted.</i>

367
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,164
<i>It's been a while,
but I'll try that thing.</i>

368
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,562
A-A dog?

369
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,605
He's good!

370
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,357
No, that's a hunting dog!

371
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,111
{\an8}<i>I've lived with dogs
for as long as I can remember.</i>

372
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,862
{\an8}<i>They taught me all sorts of things.</i>

373
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,781
<i>How to hunt,</i>

374
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,867
<i>how to take down
something stronger than you.</i>

375
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,536
<i>Now, I'll teach you!</i>

376
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,205
He's good!

377
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,456
He's really good!

378
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,624
Just like a dog!

379
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,626
<i>You're not the hunter,</i>

380
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,711
<i>you're the prey!</i>

381
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,424
Everyone, look! The illusions!

382
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,565
<i>It's finally showing itself.</i>

383
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,985
<i>If you're a beast, you know the rules.</i>

384
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,111
<i>In this fight,</i>

385
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,950
<i>the one who flinches first is the loser!</i>

386
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,079
-Laios!
-Laios!

387
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,979
Are you alive, Laios?

388
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,189
I mean, are you sane?

389
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,316
Yeah.

390
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,401
{\an8}I've got a lot of things I want to say,

391
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,612
{\an8}but why didn't you draw your sword?

392
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,031
{\an8}I got a bit too carried away
in playing the part.

393
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,912
None of the dishes turned out.

394
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,372
They were made
with the illusions, after all.

395
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,707
Let's make them again.

396
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,376
Anyway,

397
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,671
turns out your intuition
was spot on, Laios.

398
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,465
What tipped you off?

399
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,468
Maybe it was how you acted
when it came to monsters.

400
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,556
<i>First off, I noticed Chilchuck
was sitting on a wooden box.</i>

401
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,851
<i>Those are prime hiding spots
for Mimics and Tentacles.</i>

402
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,355
<i>The fact he seemed totally unfazed by it
didn't sit right with me.</i>

403
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,733
There was a nest in an old, rundown house.

404
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,985
I gathered all I could find there.

405
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,322
<i>Considering how much you care
about the ecosystem's balance,</i>

406
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,990
<i>that remark seemed rather thoughtless.</i>

407
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,993
I mean, it's not like
eating a Harpy will fix anything!

408
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,580
<i>Finally, the fact that Marcille
threw away the boiled water.</i>

409
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,209
<i>If she were being cautious of an Undine,
that action seemed reckless.</i>

410
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,128
<i>And what bothered me
was her lack of concern about it.</i>

411
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,513
In this situation, her carelessness
felt more genuine to me.

412
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,390
I see.

413
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,225
{\an8}I'm impressed.

414
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,519
{\an8}I've got a higher opinion
of you now, Laios.

415
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,854
{\an8}Even if your viewpoint is a bit off.

416
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,940
But still,

417
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,609
seeing through illusions
is practically impossible.

418
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,779
This monster banked on that one trick
to survive, after all.

419
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,906
And here I thought...

420
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,575
I've eaten Fish-man eggs
and even Dryads before.

421
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,787
<i>You caught on because of that comment.</i>

422
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,625
I mean, we've never had
Fish-man eggs before.

423
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,584
Right?

424
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,341
<i>Were they in the porridge we had that day?</i>

425
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,804
The dessert is done as well.

426
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,972
-Yay!
-Yay!

427
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,474
It's been ages
since I've had something sweet.

428
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,976
How about some tea?

429
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,563
I'm pretty sure we had tea leaves
in the provisions we got.

430
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,108
{\an8}Maybe you misplaced it.

431
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,360
{\an8}No, I'm sure I placed it right here.

432
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>The rice...</i>

433
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,592
No one's here.

434
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,057
Marcille!

435
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,851
Drop your weapons and stay still.

436
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,812
Let's talk this out peacefully.

437
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,950
