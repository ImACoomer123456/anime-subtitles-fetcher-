1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,026
<i>I smell something good.</i>

3
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,324
Senshi?

4
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,915
There he is.

5
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,875
I see you woke up.

6
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,252
Good morning.

7
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,420
You made breakfast?

8
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,674
Senshi is a very fine cook.

9
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,384
He really is.

10
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,010
Senshi is amazing.

11
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,431
BREAKFAST PREPARED BY SENSHI

12
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,189
So good!

13
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,900
Yaad, would you like to try some?

14
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,987
But I can't taste...

15
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,155
Here.

16
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,999
It's warm and soft.

17
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,294
Your sense of taste is like a muscle.

18
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,005
If you don't use it, it weakens.

19
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,925
Start by savoring the texture.

20
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,010
Right.

21
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,720
Oh, look at you.

22
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,726
Long ago, every now and then,

23
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,770
I used to sit at the table like this
with my grandfather and parents.

24
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,690
<i>Always beside my grandfather
stood Thistle,</i>

25
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,985
<i>the lunatic magician.</i>

26
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,323
<i>My great-grandfather originally
welcomed him into the castle as a jester.</i>

27
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,285
<i>They say my grandfather and Thistle
were raised together like brothers.</i>

28
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:26,122
<i>When my grandfather ascended the throne,
he encouraged Thistle to study magic.</i>

29
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,207
<i>And Thistle began to distinguish himself.</i>

30
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,879
<i>Our realm was once abundant
with relics from dwarves and elves,</i>

31
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,798
<i>likely including items of black magic.</i>

32
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,844
<i>Thistle's thirst for power consumed him
and drove him toward madness.</i>

33
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,264
<i>Ultimately, he cast a spell of immortality
over the kingdom.</i>

34
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,226
I actually want to talk to him.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,561
Where can I meet him?

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,104
Talk to him?

37
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,023
Absolutely not!

38
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,817
Having a conversation with him
is impossible.

39
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,238
<i>It was a struggle just to let
my grandfather slip away unnoticed.</i>

40
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,449
<i>Some were even put to death
on suspicion of aiding him.</i>

41
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,452
Simply meeting the magician
is easy enough.

42
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:09,165
<i>The magician's eyes are
sensing something amiss in this village.</i>

43
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,918
<i>It's only a matter of time
before he arrives himself.</i>

44
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:16,339
<i>This dungeon is like his arms and legs.</i>

45
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,384
<i>You're familiar
with his terrifying power, aren't you?</i>

46
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,595
But I still need to try.

47
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,099
I don't know if you can have
a conversation with him.

48
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,603
<i>But seek the aid of the Winged Lion
imprisoned in the depths of the dungeon.</i>

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,898
<i>You should be able
to subdue the magician's power.</i>

50
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,948
This passage will lead you
within the castle walls,

51
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,742
taking you back to the dungeon.

52
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,953
Please take this!

53
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,621
Thank you.

54
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:53,418
{\an8}Don't give them too much,
or it will burden the carriers.

55
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,627
{\an8}The carriers?

56
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,339
{\an8}I'll have them take you back
the same way they brought you here.

57
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,844
Thank you. We owe you.

58
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,721
Good luck.

59
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:15,815
I know I shouldn't say this,
but are they really the ones?

60
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,775
I'd like to think so.

61
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,239
Yaad.

62
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,907
T-Thistle!

63
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,786
Who were you talking to just now?

64
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,669
For the umpteenth time!

65
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,837
This place...

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,505
Ow...

67
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,467
{\an8}It's a reservoir
crafted by ancient dwarves.

68
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,720
{\an8}That insanely huge place, right?
Which section of it are we now?

69
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,473
My compass isn't working.

70
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:52,602
Dwarves do cunning stuff like that.

71
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,480
Apparently, it was also once
a defensive stronghold.

72
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,023
<i>Dwarves...</i>

73
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,860
Senshi, are you feeling
teleportation sickness?

74
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,363
Given dwarves' sensitive
semicircular canals, it's quite common.

75
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,699
Do gnomes suffer from it as well?

76
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,243
I think they get mana sickness too.

77
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,746
Where am I?

78
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,414
Are you back to yourself?

79
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,249
W-What...

80
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,420
Are you okay?

81
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,506
Rest there a little.

82
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,257
We'll go explore the area.

83
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,012
Chil.

84
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,515
Can you see these marks here?

85
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,894
Yeah, I see them.

86
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,064
I need you to draw the symbols
on the pillars surrounding us.

87
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,525
It will aid us in estimating
our approximate location.

88
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,610
How do you know about that?

89
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,946
These locations typically have them.

90
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,656
They're like a code.

91
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:52,745
Well, it means not all dwarves
have a strong sense of direction.

92
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,543
I've got it.

93
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,753
It seems we're in the southeast section...

94
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,172
Everyone, listen!

95
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,049
They're back.

96
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,677
We might have found Falin!

97
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,513
These are Falin's tracks?

98
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,307
She spotted us and ran away, though.

99
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,892
I'm sure it was her.

100
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,228
It was her silhouette, right?

101
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,315
I think it was a Griffin
or something similar.

102
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,944
A-A Griffin?

103
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,531
It's a monster with the upper body
of a bird and the lower body of a lion.

104
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,617
I've never heard of Griffins
being in this dungeon.

105
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,704
Do you recognize the scent?

106
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,664
I'm not a dog, you know.

107
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,461
It smells like a beast.

108
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,588
Anyway, we have to track her down quickly.

109
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,589
No.

110
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,591
Huh?

111
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,259
No? Why?

112
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,178
Well, um...

113
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,804
It might be Falin.

114
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,222
Well...

115
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,350
T-Those are mushrooms
I've never seen before.

116
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,852
I want to try cooking them.

117
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,978
Mushrooms?

118
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,981
I recall seeing them somewhere.

119
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,609
They're poisonous,
so don't think of eating them.

120
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,777
I don't like Griffins.

121
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,614
How can you dislike
a monster you've never met?

122
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,240
Whatever. Let's go!

123
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,284
-W-Wait! Don't!
-Huh?

124
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,785
It's risky to move about!

125
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,204
Watch out!

126
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,293
{\an8}I knew it.

127
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,753
It's a Griffin!

128
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,344
So cool! I've never seen one before!

129
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,803
A Griffin...

130
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,806
All that fuss for nothing!

131
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,100
It's coming back!

132
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,060
Get back!

133
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,063
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

134
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:48,402
<i>Rufermus Sperae Alamandras Tronsum.
Yovis Stantinus Histum...</i>

135
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,365
My aim!

136
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,700
Senshi! Don't run with your back to it!

137
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,210
-Senshi!
-Senshi!

138
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,095
This is bad.

139
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,015
It happened so quickly,
I couldn't do anything.

140
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,268
Did Senshi have any weapons with him?

141
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,811
No, he was unarmed.

142
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,187
We have to go after him now!

143
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,482
Will you climb up each pillar
to look for him?

144
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,067
Well, I won't.

145
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,819
<i>Which way did it go?</i>

146
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,363
<i>If it's taken him to a high place,
there's nothing we can do.</i>

147
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,073
<i>We won't even be able to find his body.</i>

148
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,033
<i>Just like that?</i>

149
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,493
<i>He was unarmed...</i>

150
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,995
<i>We might never see him again.</i>

151
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,706
Marcille, is there anything we can do?

152
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,087
We'll summon Familiars to search for him.

153
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,547
Familiars?

154
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,048
You're going to conjure monsters?

155
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,760
It's more accurate
to say "create" than "conjure."

156
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,596
There are three types of summoning.

157
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,808
<i>First, you can dominate
and control existing spirits or monsters.</i>

158
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,935
<i>But the conditions for this are complex,</i>

159
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,855
<i>and it might attract the attention
of the lord of the dungeon.</i>

160
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,525
<i>Second, you can alter
animals and plants into monsters.</i>

161
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,860
<i>But this isn't an option either,</i>

162
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,362
<i>as it takes an immense amount
of time and preparation.</i>

163
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,115
Third, you can create them from scratch.

164
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,533
This time, we'll use this method.

165
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,619
It sounds the most complicated.

166
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,663
It is if you're creating
an autonomous creature.

167
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,625
But for now,
we only need one that's mobile.

168
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,295
I'll prepare the magic circle,

169
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,714
so gather all the meat we have
and throw it into a pot.

170
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,757
Got it.

171
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,429
Is that all we have?

172
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,431
It'd be better if we had a bit more.

173
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,477
There's nothing else.

174
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,270
We do have cheese and eggs, though.

175
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,355
And vegetables!

176
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,525
I suppose they'll help boost
the calorie count.

177
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,526
Fetch them.

178
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,444
Right.

179
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,742
What kind of monster are you making?

180
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,494
Can you control it at will?

181
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,578
Show me how to do it.

182
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,496
Absolutely not!

183
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,083
Get certified to handle dangerous magic
through the proper channels first!

184
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,419
There's actually a process for that?

185
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,173
Hey, who's that old guy anyway?

186
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,175
How did he join your group?

187
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,136
And what's with his obsession with food?

188
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,098
Huh?

189
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,684
Are you saying you don't know,
after acting so friendly with him?

190
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,729
Well, we just never had the opportunity.

191
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,191
None of us are keen
on discussing our personal lives.

192
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,943
{\an8}But...

193
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,529
<i>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.</i>

194
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,448
<i>There's a lot to question
about Senshi's words and actions.</i>

195
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,660
Do you remember what he said
when we first met him?

196
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,331
He claimed to have been studying monster
food in this dungeon for over ten years.

197
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,751
<i>But this dungeon
was only discovered six years ago.</i>

198
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,211
<i>But...</i>

199
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:57,007
<i>He carries a couple of pots and knives
crafted from precious metals too.</i>

200
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,677
<i>And he managed
to decipher ancient dwarf code.</i>

201
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,805
<i>He's afraid of a monster
from a level we haven't explored yet.</i>

202
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,974
<i>And he persistently treats me
as if I'm a kid.</i>

203
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,476
The last statement is a bit too nitpicky.

204
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,436
Nope.

205
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,939
Folks who aren't familiar with our race
often make this mistake.

206
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,650
They don't get that half-foots
are their own race.

207
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,362
They think we'll turn into tall-men
or dwarves when we're grown.

208
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,655
But...

209
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,950
these misconceptions are only present
in certain places, like the East.

210
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,203
{\an8}If he's been on this island for a decade,
he should know better.

211
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,458
{\an8}Maybe he's not from the surface at all.

212
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,919
Once we manage to rescue Senshi,

213
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,589
we should reintroduce ourselves.

214
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,928
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

215
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,557
<i>Rufermus Sperae Vilal Indumreezbam.</i>

216
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,268
{\an8}<i>Martis Tilnunt Eesdum.</i>

217
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:53,355
{\an8}<i>Histum Eres Anjarkant Rementalent.</i>

218
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,198
Is it ready?

219
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,200
It should be.

220
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,827
Let's open the lid.

221
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,388
Thank goodness!

222
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,724
I was worried,
but it looks like it worked!

223
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,602
What's with the expression?
As long as they move, it's fine!

224
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,064
We can't waste limited resources
on unnecessary details!

225
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,357
Okay, fly!

226
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,528
What's wrong?

227
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,156
Their vision is overlapping with mine,
and it's making me sick.

228
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,659
Someone, cover my eyes.

229
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,372
The lunatic magician
controls many of these.

230
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,707
How does he manage all the information?

231
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,917
I'm so curious.

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,752
Save that for later.

233
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,045
Right now, focus on Senshi.

234
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,381
I'll look for any foreign objects

235
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,424
by following
the Dungeon Cleaners and spirits.

236
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,301
Follow me!

237
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,598
You can't follow, is that it?

238
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,184
I-It's not easy to walk while flying!

239
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,936
I'll carry her.

240
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,021
Izutsumi and Chil, take my stuff.

241
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,065
Here we go, Marcille.

242
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,651
What? I'm scared!

243
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,486
Put your arms around me.

244
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,280
No! I'm going to fall!

245
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,447
Stay still or you will fall!

246
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,452
What kind of position is that?

247
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,746
It seems like
this is the most comfortable for her.

248
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,132
The Dungeon Cleaners
are gathering around that pillar!

249
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,466
That's probably where...

250
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,304
Senshi!

251
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,680
I found him!

252
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,765
He's pinned high up on a pillar!

253
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,934
Griffins impale their prey, huh?

254
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,769
<i>We're here to rescue you, Senshi!</i>

255
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,271
<i>Can you tell who I am?</i>

256
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,188
A fly?

257
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,902
<i>He won't budge.</i>

258
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,320
<i>How can I get him down?</i>

259
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,196
Careful, Marcille.

260
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,324
Griffins have incredibly sharp eyes.

261
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,661
By the time we spot them,
they've already spotted you.

262
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,458
I can't see anything anymore.

263
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,794
A Griffin's body is highly functional.

264
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,630
Their wings are powerful.

265
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,507
Their supple bodies are agile,
with explosive power.

266
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,052
Their beaks and talons are sharp as well.

267
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,803
Outwitting one will be very challenging.

268
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,349
<i>Creatures are shaped
the way they are out of necessity.</i>

269
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,559
<i>They don't have unnecessary details.</i>

270
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,856
{\an8}Laios, what form would be effective
against a Griffin?

271
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,404
Do we really need that horn?

272
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,240
Streamlined bodies
experience less air resistance,

273
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,952
which should enhance agility.

274
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,081
<i>Remember the Wyverns
under the lunatic magician's control?</i>

275
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,999
<i>They were as swift as arrows.</i>

276
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,834
<i>Let's try to replicate their shape.</i>

277
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,798
This should do for now.

278
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,840
Try flying it.

279
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,763
It's flying completely differently!

280
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,056
We should have a chance now!

281
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,183
While Senshi climbs down,

282
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,268
I'll keep the Griffin distracted!

283
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,562
Everyone else, be prepared to fight
and provide backup!

284
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,065
Why's she doing that?

285
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,317
Maybe she needs to feel a sense of unity.

286
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>Come on, Senshi.</i>

287
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,279
<i>Use this rope!</i>

288
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,573
<i>Good, and now...</i>

289
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>It's fast!</i>

290
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,704
<i>I'll draw the Griffin away!</i>

291
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,288
<i>Come on, follow me!</i>

292
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,712
<i>Now, back to the ground!</i>

293
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,469
It got me.

294
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,513
It's not good enough...

295
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,598
I'm no match for it at all.

296
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,516
What should I do?

297
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,560
I've got it! Leave it to me!

298
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,770
I'll make it stronger and tougher!

299
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,357
I'll add horns, give it fangs
and sharp claws!

300
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,235
I'll cover it with scales
and even add another head!

301
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,571
With more potential,
it's sure to be strong!

302
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,156
And it'll breathe fire and ice too!

303
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,240
So cool!

304
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,534
<i>How do I take down a Griffin?</i>

305
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,662
<i>Do I need to focus on offense or defense?</i>

306
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>No!</i>

307
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,920
-My Giga Double-headed Flame Ice Dragon!
-<i>We don't need claws or fangs.</i>

308
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,049
<i>It should be faster, more lithe,
and more beautiful.</i>

309
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:34,928
<i>What's needed here is determination
and ego to make a creature</i>

310
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,930
<i>with the single goal of rescuing Senshi!</i>

311
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,434
<i>At that moment, Marcille's intense passion</i>

312
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,810
<i>and her prayers</i>

313
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,772
<i>brought about a miracle.</i>

314
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,316
I'll give you a name.

315
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,943
With silver-white wings
that streak across the skies...

316
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,323
I summon the Sky Fish!

317
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,033
It's so...

318
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,076
lame.

319
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,368
No, this is fine!

320
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,662
Now, go!

321
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,838
-It's so fast!
-The way it moves is gross!

322
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,465
I'm going all out!

323
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,966
Everyone, get ready!

324
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,385
Seriously, what's her deal?

325
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,554
She's putting in her best effort,
that's what.

326
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,148
<i>I can't change course!</i>

327
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,945
<i>This time!</i>

328
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,906
<i>I'll turn around and...</i>

329
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,617
<i>Punch through!</i>

330
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,184
Are you okay?

331
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,686
Y-Yeah.

332
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,729
You should take a break for a bit.

333
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,024
We'll start cooking,
so just rest over there.

334
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,909
Thank you.

335
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,370
You did well.

336
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,622
<i>Sky Fish...</i>

337
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,378
This is amazing.

338
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,881
The vegetables
are packed inside like organs.

339
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,385
Did you still need it?

340
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,179
No, but...

341
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,099
I was expecting you
to mourn a bit, you know?

342
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,767
I wanted some time for that.

343
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,227
-Are you okay, Senshi?
-Marcille.

344
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,730
They've already fulfilled their lives.

345
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,274
Consuming their bodies
is a way to honor them.

346
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,484
But still...

347
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,989
Fine. Do as you want.

348
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,743
<i>Cut the Familiar into appropriate lengths.</i>

349
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,495
<i>Remove the wings at the base.</i>

350
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,290
<i>Dab away excess moisture with a cloth,</i>

351
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,751
<i>and season with salt and pepper.</i>

352
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,628
<i>Fold the wings up small.</i>

353
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:18,175
<i>Blend flour, egg, and water thoroughly,
then coat the slices in the mixture.</i>

354
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,384
<i>And deep fry them.</i>

355
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,222
<i>The wings will brown quickly
so a quick dip will do.</i>

356
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,349
<i>Serve with sauce and...</i>

357
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,142
It's done!

358
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,062
SKY FISH AND CHIPS

359
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,321
The meat and vegetables
have melded together and it's delicious!

360
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,697
Yeah, literally.

361
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,409
Summoning might actually be
a superior cooking technique!

362
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,538
If it consumes a week's worth of food
for just one meal, it's hardly superior.

363
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,209
Damn. I should've
taken their liquor along.

364
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,212
Izutsumi, eat the other parts too,
not just the wings.

365
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,129
I don't want to.

366
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,590
Senshi, have a bite too.

367
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,428
Is the Griffin bothering you?

368
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,596
Want to drain the blood?

369
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,015
N-No, never mind.

370
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,018
I'm not hungry right now.

371
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,606
Hey, Senshi.

372
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,777
My name's Chilchuck.

373
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,948
I'm from a small village
nestled in a basin, northeast of here.

374
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,701
For about a decade,

375
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,328
I've been doing business
around different dungeons.

376
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,082
From picking locks to interpreting,
mediating, and appraising.

377
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,544
{\an8}Also, I have a wife and daughters,

378
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,963
{\an8}but I haven't seen them in years
for various reasons.

379
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,880
What?

380
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,342
-That's pretty much my backstory.
-A wife and daughters?

381
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,387
Now, tell us about yourself.

382
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,098
Why are you living down here?

383
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,933
What happened?

384
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,692
My name is Senshi of Izganda.

385
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,612
I used to belong to a small mining crew.

386
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:08,327
<i>We were miners, but not for ore.</i>

387
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,912
<i>We sought relics from before the war,</i>

388
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,498
<i>dreaming of hitting the jackpot.</i>

389
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,502
<i>That said, the majority
of our discoveries were ore,</i>

390
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:22,883
<i>and finding relics like gears or lenses
was a rare stroke of luck.</i>

391
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,344
{\an8}<i>Then, one day,</i>

392
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,181
{\an8}<i>we unearthed something huge.</i>

393
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,353
<i>An ancient castle gleaming with gold.</i>

394
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,775
That's right. It was this very dungeon.

395
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,950
