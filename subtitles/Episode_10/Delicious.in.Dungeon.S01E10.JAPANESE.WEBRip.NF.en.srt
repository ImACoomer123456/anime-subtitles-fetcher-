1
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,862
Hey, are you sure we're on the right path?

3
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,906
Yup, these are the stairs we need to take.

4
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,534
After these steps,
we'll reach the fifth basement floor,

5
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
close to the orc settlement.

6
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,246
At least that's what it says on the map.

7
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,583
How are we supposed
to go down these steps?

8
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,919
This is incredible.

9
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,505
There's a wide variety
of Tentacles growing here.

10
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,258
The orcs totally made a fool of us.

11
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,343
They kindly laid a trap for us.

12
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,511
I'm not so sure.

13
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,513
This route leads to their settlement.

14
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,267
It's ideal for keeping away
outsiders at least.

15
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,894
Let's try moving forward.

16
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:29,774
Given the time and effort that would take,
taking a detour might be a quicker option.

17
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,405
Marcille, don't get
too close to the walls.

18
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,159
These creatures lurk within the walls.

19
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,288
<i>Places teeming with Tentacles
have just as many cavities.</i>

20
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,915
<i>It also means
there are many traps and devices.</i>

21
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,126
<i>The Tentacles crush
and break these devices</i>

22
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>and they even grow on treasure chests,
working mischief together with the traps.</i>

23
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,174
<i>They're monsters
I want to see exterminated next to Mimics!</i>

24
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,343
There.

25
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,888
I think we made some pretty good progress...

26
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,560
Strange.

27
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,479
The orcs must've used this path
to climb to the third floor.

28
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,940
How did they manage to navigate this area?

29
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,484
Something's here.

30
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,736
Be careful.

31
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,037
Kensuke!

32
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,788
It's a Giant Frog!

33
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,665
Ugh, so gross!

34
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,918
No way!

35
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,794
I got this! <i>Aslam!</i>

36
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,801
No!

37
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,138
Ambrosia!

38
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,022
Senshi, behind you!

39
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,527
Don't let go!

40
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,904
Hang in there, Senshi!

41
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,489
M-Magic...

42
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,908
-It should be close enough.
-No! It's too close!

43
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,785
<i>This is bad.</i>

44
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,161
<i>What do we do?</i>

45
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,289
<i>Is that a trap?</i>

46
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:12,168
<i>There's a Tentacles growing unnaturally
from the wall next to the frog.</i>

47
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,296
<i>It's probably growing out
of the exit of a trap.</i>

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,549
<i>If I can extract it,
I could trigger the trap.</i>

49
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,301
<i>But...</i>

50
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,262
<i>how do I pull it out?</i>

51
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,764
<i>If I touch it directly,
my hands will get swollen.</i>

52
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,185
Laios!

53
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,939
Why are Giant Frogs safe
even when in contact with the Tentacles?

54
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,692
Huh?

55
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,609
No idea.

56
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,444
Maybe it's their biological makeup.

57
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,447
<i>So, you don't have any info on this?</i>

58
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,450
Children can be inquisitive
regardless of the situation, huh?

59
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,035
Fine!

60
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,882
Chilchuck!

61
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,513
<i>It doesn't hurt!</i>

62
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>I can do this!</i>

63
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,349
Huh?

64
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,560
<i>I can't pull it out!</i>

65
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,112
-Chilchuck!
-Chilchuck!

66
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,374
Chilchuck!

67
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,214
He's alive.

68
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,215
Show me your hands!

69
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,468
Huh? They're unhurt.

70
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,844
I see.

71
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,430
He wrapped his hands
with the skin of a Giant Frog.

72
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,348
Well done!

73
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,853
Chilchuck,

74
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,315
this is a really great idea!

75
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,860
<i>Dissect a Giant Frog</i>

76
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,613
<i>and remove the skin from its body.</i>

77
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,239
U-Um, hey...

78
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,533
Peel the Tentacles

79
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,496
and save the narrow sections for later.

80
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,498
Boil the thicker portions,

81
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,501
then, after boiling, mash them
and knead with flour.

82
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:20,004
Shape the mixture into sticks,
and slice them into bite-sized pieces,

83
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,964
and boil once more.

84
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,924
Hey...

85
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,510
Lightly dry the Giant Frog skins,

86
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,513
<i>take various measurements, and sew.</i>

87
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,141
Heat olive oil, garlic,
and hot pepper in a pan,

88
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,020
then add the thigh meat of a Giant Frog
and sauté them together.

89
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,480
-It's done!
-It's done!

90
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,024
{\an8}TENTACLES GNOCCHI,
TENTACLES PASTA, FROG SUIT

91
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,401
<i>Ugh, just great!</i>

92
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,195
Bring them to me one person at a time!

93
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,281
You guys finished your tasks
while I was debating which of you to stop!

94
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,575
Come on, now, just give it a try.

95
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,578
Yes, give it a bite at least.

96
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,789
I said one person at a time!

97
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,917
And who knows
whether they're really safe or not?

98
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,629
WHISPER

99
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:05,383
{\an8}I think you'll look
really cute in it, Marcille.

100
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,857
You look so cute!

101
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,525
The color really suits you.

102
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,778
I like how your ears are contributing
to that frog-like silhouette.

103
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,321
Let's get moving.

104
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,448
Right.

105
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,413
Wow! It doesn't hurt at all!

106
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,790
Ugh, this is so disgusting!

107
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,792
How beautiful.

108
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,044
It's delicious.

109
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,593
Kensuke!

110
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,802
Thank goodness!

111
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,306
Look!

112
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,225
It's the castle town.

113
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,394
We're already on the fifth floor!

114
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,401
There are signs
of people fleeing in panic.

115
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,404
It seems the orcs were speaking the truth.

116
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,908
It's certain that there's
a Red Dragon around here.

117
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,994
Let's stay vigilant
and ready for combat as we move ahead.

118
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,289
Huh?

119
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,001
It seems like the Giant Frog's blood

120
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,546
has congealed inside
and got stuck to my clothes.

121
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,050
{\an8}We didn't have enough time
to dry the skins, after all.

122
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,928
Are we going
to fight the dragon like this?

123
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,434
How am I supposed
to reunite with Falin now, huh?!

124
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,061
Answer me!

125
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,828
-It feels like my insides are spinning.
-Kiki, Kaka.

126
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,998
Show Namari to the guest room
so she can rest.

127
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,836
{\an8}I will go to report
to the Lord of the Island.

128
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,846
<i>So, how was it inside the dungeon?</i>

129
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,516
The most concerning thing

130
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,851
is that it has become a rough place.

131
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,062
{\an8}All the treasures down
to the third basement floor

132
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,564
{\an8}have been plundered.

133
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,358
{\an8}And there are now
more hangouts for outlaws.

134
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,776
<i>What's worse,</i>

135
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:34,115
<i>orc hordes have started appearing
on the upper floors and causing trouble.</i>

136
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,743
You should consider deploying a troop
or offering rewards to deal with them.

137
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,123
I wonder where the orcs entered from.

138
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,168
I suspect that some old dwarf mines
might be connected to the dungeon.

139
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,130
Orcs tend to inhabit such passages.

140
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,881
Dwarves, huh?

141
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,009
How abominable.

142
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,760
<i>They're like moles.</i>

143
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,014
<i>No matter how you seal off their passages,
they keep making more.</i>

144
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,515
<i>A long time ago,</i>

145
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,436
<i>the elves and dwarves divided
into the east and west in conflict.</i>

146
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,357
<i>They say the dwarves hid in these lands
and waited for the arrival of the elves.</i>

147
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,901
Even after the war,
they continued to dig tunnels,

148
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,780
eventually swallowing the Golden City
and turning it into a dungeon.

149
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,326
I hear that the surviving dwarves
are responsible

150
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,120
for the dungeon's ongoing expansion.

151
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,165
That rumor cannot be trusted.

152
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,668
Anyhow, here is the magic circle I copied.

153
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,171
It's in Elvish, like all the others.

154
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,591
And based on the handwriting,
the author is likely the same individual.

155
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:37,678
There are absolutely no traces
of anyone tampering with it.

156
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,639
{\an8}The lord of the dungeon,

157
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:44,185
{\an8}the lunatic magician,
is most certainly the one who made this.

158
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,604
Is he an elf?

159
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,606
I can't be certain,

160
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,734
but this magic is beyond
the capabilities of a tall-man or a dwarf.

161
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,444
What a tricky situation.

162
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,824
The thing is, I received a letter
from the western elves the other day.

163
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>It said, "The dungeon is our heritage.
Return it to us."</i>

164
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,123
{\an8}What a selfish demand!

165
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,376
{\an8}They're the ones who took this land
from the dwarves

166
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,295
{\an8}and handed it over to humans because
they didn't know what to do with it!

167
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,381
Ignore them.

168
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,717
This land was granted
by the king of the elves himself.

169
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,052
I can't just do that.

170
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,556
{\an8}They'll take this island, too.

171
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,350
That won't do.

172
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:28,813
There must be great treasure
still hidden in that dungeon.

173
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,064
Lord of the Island,

174
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,942
the elves aren't after the treasure.

175
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,195
<i>They're after the spell of immortality
that is cast on the dungeon.</i>

176
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,491
{\an8}The magic that ties the soul to the body
is still a big mystery.

177
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:45,704
{\an8}When that mystery is solved,
its worth will far surpass that of gold.

178
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,874
We must figure it out before the elves do.

179
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,169
Are you suggesting we copy
every single magic circle to study them?

180
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,712
Listen carefully!

181
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,675
When such great magic is involved,
there is always a blueprint.

182
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,218
Get your hands on it!

183
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,470
As long as you have it,

184
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,849
you can give up the dungeon
or anything you please.

185
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,144
Once the elves know you possess it,

186
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,646
they will finally treat you as an equal,

187
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:15,025
{\an8}no, they will kneel before you
to negotiate with you.

188
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,986
I-Is that so?

189
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,780
So? Where can I find this blueprint?

190
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,282
That's simple.

191
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,785
It's likely in the possession
of the lord of the dungeon.

192
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,205
In other words, you want me
to keep backing the explorers?

193
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,498
Precisely.

194
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,585
Don't bargain down the prices
for hunting monsters

195
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,044
and the loot from the dungeons.

196
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,506
Don't hoard your wealth
and provide even more support.

197
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,175
Very well.

198
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,802
I'll offer rewards for taking down orcs.

199
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,512
What do I say to the elves?

200
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,056
I'll help you buy time.

201
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,895
<i>Laios, was it?</i>

202
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,481
<i>He was a skilled adventurer,</i>

203
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,859
<i>but I wonder how far
his party can advance.</i>

204
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,909
Good morning, Namari.

205
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,494
How are you feeling?

206
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,497
My axe!

207
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,832
Your stuff is right here.

208
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,917
And

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,920
here's money from Grandpa Tansu.

210
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,006
It's more than I expected.

211
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,799
There might be a little break,

212
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,885
but he said he wanted
to request your help again.

213
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,929
T-Thanks.

214
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,138
I owe you.

215
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,807
I'll walk you to the street.

216
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,437
Do you have a home?

217
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,813
Or do you stay at an inn?

218
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,775
Neither. I'm heading toward the dungeon.

219
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,568
Why?

220
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,070
You're going under again?

221
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,279
No.

222
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,573
I have an errand to the nearby temple.

223
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,659
An errand?

224
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,660
An errand?

225
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,087
It's the resurrection office.

226
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,589
Namari!

227
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,176
Is it true you left Laios' party?

228
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,930
So, what are you looking for?
An item or a person?

229
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,014
A person.

230
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,892
{\an8}A female tall-man with light brown hair.

231
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,978
{\an8}It's around shoulder length.

232
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,271
{\an8}She's somewhere between...

233
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,691
her teens and her forties.

234
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,277
Wait. Do you mean Laios' sister?

235
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,321
She's in her twenties at most.

236
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,031
You should get your eyes checked.

237
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,535
It's hard to guess the age
of people from other races, okay?

238
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,664
We have no corpse here
that fits that description.

239
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,583
I see.

240
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,794
<i>On the fifth basement floor,</i>

241
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:43,173
<i>outside the Golden Castle,
lies the castle town.</i>

242
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,177
<i>The streets, expanded and warped by magic,</i>

243
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:52,182
<i>show traces of a time
when they bustled with activity.</i>

244
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,686
<i>Figures pass by the edge of your vision.</i>

245
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,188
<i>You hear whispers.</i>

246
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,525
<i>Such peculiar sensations wash over you.</i>

247
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,697
Seems like this was the location
for the orc settlement.

248
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,283
They must have left in quite a rush.

249
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,702
The pantry doors are left wide open.

250
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,579
What an awful stench.

251
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,206
Looks like the monsters in this area
scavenged this place.

252
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,168
It seems the flour and alcohol
are safe, though.

253
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,046
Let's make bread.

254
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,214
The orcs won't be happy
when they come back.

255
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,718
We gave them vegetables,
so it's a fair exchange.

256
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,899
Wargs.

257
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,944
It wasn't a fire, was it?

258
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,111
No.

259
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,530
They were defeated
by the Red Dragon's fire breath.

260
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,661
{\an8}The dragon passed through here
not too long ago.

261
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,412
H-Hey.

262
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,456
You mentioned before

263
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,918
that dragons sleep most of the time
and rarely move about.

264
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,922
But based on what the orcs told us
and the current situation,

265
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,924
it's still on the move.

266
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,426
It's likely roaming
around this area even now.

267
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,805
We might've had a chance
against a sleeping dragon.

268
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,933
But do you really think we could defeat it
with our current strength?

269
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,185
What if we lose again?

270
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,437
{\an8}What if she's already digested?

271
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,855
Calm down.

272
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,148
We don't know that yet.

273
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,942
Let's figure out a plan first.

274
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,860
But taking on the dragon

275
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,446
with just the three of you
is gonna be tough.

276
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,657
The three of us?

277
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,454
{\an8}I keep telling you this,
but don't count on me to help in combat!

278
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,457
{\an8}My only job
is to get you to your destination!

279
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,834
{\an8}We know that.

280
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,752
{\an8}We're not blaming you.

281
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,963
{\an8}M-My mistake then.

282
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,383
How have you defeated dragons in the past?

283
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,344
It depends on the time, circumstances,
and the type of dragon.

284
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,848
<i>But usually, Falin casts a spell
to protect against fire and harm.</i>

285
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,392
<i>Then, Namari, Shuro, and I
work to slow it down.</i>

286
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>Marcille weakens the dragon
with explosive spells.</i>

287
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,356
<i>Finally, Shuro strikes the killing blow
when the opportunity arises.</i>

288
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,026
I think that's how it usually goes.

289
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,863
{\an8}Of course, it was only possible
because of that team.

290
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,366
Now, we have to figure out a plan
for just the three of us.

291
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,828
<i>Dragons are resistant
to spells and weapons.</i>

292
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,998
<i>It's because they're covered
in steel-like scales.</i>

293
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,125
<i>Their only weak spot
where you can land a killing blow</i>

294
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,753
<i>is the underside of their neck.</i>

295
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,880
Stab it there, and we win!

296
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,506
The underside of their neck, huh?

297
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,135
How large is this Red Dragon?

298
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,720
Let's see...

299
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,764
Look over there.

300
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,724
See that half-collapsed walkway?

301
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,392
It's about that tall.

302
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,518
I mean,

303
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,730
isn't it broken
because the dragon bumped its head on it?

304
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,273
You're right.

305
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,733
It's massive.

306
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,403
Striking it at that height
is almost impossible.

307
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,030
That's exactly the problem.

308
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,992
Let's make our way to the walkway.

309
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,954
It's so high.

310
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,457
What if we try jumping
onto the dragon's neck from here?

311
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,542
-No way!
-Forget it.

312
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,878
I can cast defense spells,

313
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,005
but I'm not as skilled as Falin.

314
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,883
I can't protect you
from a fall from this height

315
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,551
or from fire breath.

316
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,429
Yeah, what about its fire breath?

317
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,056
Up here, there's nowhere for us to run.

318
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,433
And according to Namari,

319
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,936
Senshi's axe won't even
make a dent in the dragon.

320
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,688
Are you sure your sword
can hurt it, Laios?

321
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,400
To cast an explosive spell
strong enough to stun a dragon,

322
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,861
I'll need you to buy me a lot of time.

323
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,697
On top of that,
someone needs to land the killing blow.

324
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,243
Can you and Senshi handle all that?

325
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,120
We'll find a way somehow.

326
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,496
How?

327
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,584
{\an8}Rather than aiming for its head,

328
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,337
{\an8}what if we blow up a building?

329
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:55,342
There are a lot of bridges and walkways
between buildings here.

330
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,095
We could set off an explosion
just as the dragon passes underneath.

331
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,639
The debris will trap the dragon,

332
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,808
bringing its weak spot within reach.

333
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,352
Then, we could strike
without worrying about a counterattack.

334
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,357
It's true that the two of us can't buy you
enough time to set up your spell.

335
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,861
But we could make a run for it
and lead the dragon on a chase.

336
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,030
The streets here are
too narrow for the Red Dragon,

337
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,867
and it's probably feeling worn out
after all its activity.

338
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,787
If we lead it along the right path,
we could tire it out even more.

339
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,122
I see.

340
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,540
I could help with that.

341
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,499
Really?

342
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,627
Thank you! You're the best!

343
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,338
Still, why isn't it sleeping?

344
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,632
Its appearance on the fifth floor
is a mystery, too.

345
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,927
It's persistently prowling
these narrow streets that it dislikes.

346
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,013
Could it be its mating season?

347
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,014
No...

348
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,516
Hey, didn't Namari mention something

349
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,768
about Senshi's pot
being made of seriously tough metal?

350
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,353
What was it again?

351
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,857
"It shields against a dragon's something
and can shatter a dragon's something."

352
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,483
You're right!

353
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,777
She said every blacksmith dreams of it!

354
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,696
If it shields
against a dragon's something,

355
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,947
it's gotta be fire breath!

356
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,409
Well, that solves the fire breath problem.

357
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,287
Isn't your cooking knife
made from special metal, too?

358
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,415
We should've had Namari take a look at it.

359
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,751
I'm feeling pretty hopeful now.

360
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,420
When you put your mind to it,
a way opens, huh?

361
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,379
All right!

362
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,548
Let's do our research
to map out our luring route!

363
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,027
{\an8}So, you're back.

364
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,322
{\an8}Senshi, you slipped away
without a heads-up!

365
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,823
I was making bread.

366
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,701
Did you have to do it right before
we're facing a dragon?

367
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,245
Absolutely.

368
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,372
We have a big mission ahead,

369
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,707
and the most important thing
is to fill our stomachs.

370
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,879
We lost to the Red Dragon
because of hunger once.

371
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,298
We shouldn't make the same mistake, right?

372
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,467
Wine!

373
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,470
I humbly took some from the pantry.

374
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,765
Save it for after we defeat the dragon.

375
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,934
We're missing eggs,

376
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,353
but these should be enough
to make that dish.

377
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,774
Grate the bread into crumbs,

378
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,528
and marinate the Giant Frog meat
with salt and pepper.

379
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,531
Dip it in a water and flour batter,

380
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,032
and coat it with bread crumbs.

381
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,035
Heat up some olive oil, and deep fry.

382
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,792
Boil down red wine
with seasoning to make a sauce.

383
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,130
{\an8}It's done!

384
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,549
{\an8}CUTLETS TO CONQUER THE RED DRAGON

385
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,883
That looks amazing!

386
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,803
The smell is making me hungry.

387
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,805
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

388
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,808
It's so crispy!

389
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,938
Are you okay, Marcille?

390
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,233
{\an8}The thought of not having
to eat monsters soon

391
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,568
{\an8}is making me emotional.

392
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,070
{\an8}There's still the Red Dragon, though.

393
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,785
Listen,

394
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,829
there's something
I want to say to you all.

395
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,333
I doubt I could've made it
all this way on my own.

396
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,085
Senshi, thank you so much.

397
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,963
You were kind
to complete strangers like us.

398
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,341
Your excellent cooking
not only satisfied our hunger

399
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,468
but it lifted our spirits as well.

400
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,888
Chilchuck, without you,
we would've had to take multiple detours,

401
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,681
which would have caused days of delay.

402
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,100
Above all, you were dependable.

403
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,935
And Marcille,

404
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,646
I'm sorry for the tough time you had
on this unfamiliar journey.

405
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,108
When you said you'd join me,
I was so moved.

406
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,820
Everyone, thank you so much.

407
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,950
-S-Sure.
-S-Sure.

408
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,993
Poor timing!

409
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,495
Sorry.

410
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,999
What's this?

411
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,144
Seeing it again, it really is huge.

412
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,606
Could we really defeat it?

413
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,942
Don't worry.

414
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,444
The four of us have made it this far.

415
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,906
As per the plan,
Marcille will take her position,

416
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,200
and we'll lure the dragon!

417
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,202
Is everyone ready?

418
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,204
Is everyone in good shape?

419
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,289
All right.

420
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,333
Let's go!

421
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,927
