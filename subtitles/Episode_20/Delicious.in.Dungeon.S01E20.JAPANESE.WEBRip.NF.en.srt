1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,979
I don't recognize this road.

3
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,523
This <i>is</i> the way.

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,816
Are you sure?

5
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,070
Pick up the pace! Get a move on!

6
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,238
I think we're stuck.

7
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,614
Don't push!

8
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,241
-Hey!
-Watch out...

9
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,082
This open space
is where we fought the Red Dragon!

10
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,963
You made it all the way here
on your last expedition?

11
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,589
Yeah.

12
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,843
For a long time, this spot
was believed to be the deepest point.

13
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,055
But recently, they found a door nearby
that seems to go even deeper.

14
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,851
It's engraved with a design,
and they think it opens with magic.

15
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,855
<i>We came to sketch the design
for the Lord of the Island, but...</i>

16
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,403
<i>You encountered the Red Dragon
and were forced to retreat.</i>

17
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,698
All right, let's try our luck.

18
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,075
I think we were over there last time.

19
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,079
I found our gear!

20
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,873
It's been ransacked.

21
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,082
No!

22
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,335
{\an8}Yes!

23
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,004
I found my sleeping bag!

24
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,464
Great. My underwear's still here too.

25
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,050
Those are things you prioritize
over your valuables?

26
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,220
All our food is gone,

27
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,306
but everything else seems untouched.

28
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,182
Guess it was monsters that did this.

29
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,559
I'm so glad.

30
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,686
Now I can sleep warm tonight...

31
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,774
That's not good.

32
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,068
Let's find a place to rest for a bit.

33
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,570
I want to organize my gear too.

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,115
Maybe the snow slows down the Cleaners.

35
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,242
They've gotten at my soap.

36
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,285
Hey, none of that.

37
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,412
Show me whatever you just stashed away.

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,167
Here, Marcille.

39
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,251
Ow.

40
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,087
Talk about an untrained beast-man.

41
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,757
No wonder they slapped that collar on you.

42
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,177
You're called a half-foot, right?

43
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,971
I've never seen your kind in the East.

44
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,098
I had to come here
to learn about you folks.

45
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,143
{\an8}That odd name for your race.

46
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:52,023
{\an8}I heard it's because lots of you
got a foot lopped off for stealing.

47
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,027
Come on, you two, cut it out.

48
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,029
Marcille!

49
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,280
Come here!

50
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,952
It's a fish!

51
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,538
Is there a way to cut out
just this section?

52
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,792
Maybe with a magic circle...

53
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,836
Right. Want to give it a shot, Laios?

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,880
I'll show you how to draw a magic circle.

55
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,758
How's your mana sickness been lately?

56
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,593
I don't get so dizzy anymore.

57
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>The hallucinations
are getting stronger, though.</i>

58
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,684
{\an8}<i>It's fish I used to catch
on the fourth floor.</i>

59
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,189
<i>The water from the upper floors
has flowed down here and froze.</i>

60
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,943
<i>Looks like all sorts of stuff
end up in the stream.</i>

61
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,446
And now the circle's ready.

62
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,282
{\an8}How do you feel?

63
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,950
{\an8}A little tired.

64
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,077
I'll activate it then.

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,498
Imagine it as pouring water
into the symbols you've etched.

66
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,336
What on earth?

67
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,963
The ground, it's...

68
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,218
A-A monster?

69
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,845
An Ice Golem?

70
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,350
<i>I see.</i>

71
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,108
Hey! Above you!

72
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,109
Watch out!

73
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,447
Laios!

74
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,919
So how do we take this thing down?

75
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,589
The only way to stop Golems
is by breaking their core!

76
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,715
{\an8}Their core?

77
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,841
{\an8}And where do I find that?

78
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,851
Hey! Where's the core?

79
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,519
Hang on a second!

80
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,813
<i>Is that its core? No, it's just a fish.</i>

81
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,940
<i>There's too much junk in there to tell.</i>

82
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,069
Hey! Keep that thing distracted
and buy me some time!

83
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,320
I can't spot the core yet!

84
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,446
Huh?!

85
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,326
<i>That jerk better not be making stuff up
to bring me down.</i>

86
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,125
{\an8}The snow!

87
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,262
<i>It stopped.</i>

88
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,484
Hey, you done yet?

89
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,194
How much longer do I have to keep this up?

90
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,946
That's good, Izutsumi. Well done!

91
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,079
Good. Perfect!

92
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,832
You better not be messing around!

93
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,334
No, idiot. Check where my arrow landed.

94
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,466
Also, I can use projectiles,

95
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,427
but I can't do much damage with them.

96
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,972
So don't count on me in a battle!

97
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,306
I'll let you handle the rest!

98
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,019
<i>Oh, well.</i>

99
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,397
<i>Now that I know how to take it down...</i>

100
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,176
{\an8}Seems like I'm the only one here
who's actually useful.

101
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,511
The rest of you are just...

102
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,729
Is everyone okay?

103
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,647
It'll warm up soon.

104
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,443
That magic circle can get pretty hot,
so watch out for burns.

105
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,362
Take off your wet clothes
and dry them out.

106
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,405
You too.

107
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,657
{\an8}I'll give you some cover.

108
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,993
Laios, can you change on your own?

109
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,497
Someone lend him a hand.

110
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,417
No need to shield me.

111
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,419
{\an8}But you can't just...

112
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,973
It's not like anyone would be excited
to see a beast get naked.

113
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:37,808
What's the big idea?

114
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,603
{\an8}I just didn't want you catching a chill.

115
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,814
At least let me count her nipples,
or see the base of her tail!

116
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,905
It's starting to get warm.

117
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,616
Let's prepare something hot.

118
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,536
We've got to thaw this out.

119
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,664
Maybe I can melt it over the magic circle.

120
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,918
Too close.

121
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,920
This is nice, though.

122
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,046
It feels like a sauna.

123
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,799
It's been ages since we had a bath.

124
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,384
Let's sweat it out!

125
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,182
That thing comes off?

126
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,559
Why am I blindfolded?

127
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,437
<i>I'll clean the fish, then use the head
and bones to brew up some broth.</i>

128
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,940
We might end up smelling like fish.

129
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,443
<i>Thinly slice the mushrooms and Nightmares.</i>

130
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,197
<i>Give the Shapeshifter meat a quick boil
to skim off any scum.</i>

131
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,533
<i>Whisk the Harpy egg,</i>

132
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,786
<i>then mix it in with the broth
and other ingredients.</i>

133
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,958
<i>Pour it all into cups,</i>

134
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,211
<i>set them in a pot
with the Ice Golem fragments,</i>

135
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,254
<i>and heat it up.</i>

136
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,215
Look. I made this out of her shed hair.

137
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,216
How bored are you?

138
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,595
Finally, garnish with Mandrake leaves.

139
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,887
And it's done...

140
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,389
Hey!

141
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,808
You can't just start eating on your own.

142
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,394
Wait until everyone is at the table.

143
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,562
Why not?

144
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,106
I took down the enemy all by myself!

145
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,650
I deserve to eat first!

146
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,653
Meals begin when everyone's present.

147
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,240
Chilchuck, Laios went outside.
Can you go fetch him?

148
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,158
Got it.

149
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,161
This feels great.

150
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,662
Is this guy for real?

151
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,831
ICE GOLEM SAVORY EGG CUSTARD

152
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,666
AND COOKED FISH
TAKEN FROM THE ICE GOLEM

153
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,919
All right, now that we're all here,

154
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,630
let's start eating!

155
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,922
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

156
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,425
It's pudding.

157
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,094
Sorry, Marcille.

158
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,304
Yum!

159
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,640
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

160
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,807
Hey, Izutsumi.

161
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,476
What is it?

162
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,685
This is for you.

163
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,396
I patched up a torn bag.

164
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,522
You can use it.

165
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,443
Listen.

166
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,987
{\an8}I apologize for calling you a beast.

167
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,281
{\an8}I've got a sharp tongue.

168
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,493
Traveling together
with a bunch of strangers

169
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,120
can feel suffocating
and annoying at first.

170
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,665
But once you get used to it,
there are perks.

171
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,834
You can get others
to handle stuff you can't.

172
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,387
{\an8}-That was delicious.
-That was delicious.

173
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,514
{\an8}Yeah.

174
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,851
Hey, are you done yet?

175
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,812
Just a little longer.

176
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,231
Like this and that...

177
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,482
There we go!

178
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,151
Ta-da!

179
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,906
These are Namari's clothes,
but don't they suit her perfectly?

180
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,408
They're hard to move in.

181
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,785
It took some time to adjust them.

182
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,328
I got all chilled again.

183
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,704
I'm sorry, okay?

184
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,831
Well, let's hit the road.

185
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,748
Wait.

186
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,379
These are Mandrakes boiled sweet.

187
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,382
I figured they'd make
for good travel food.

188
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,262
Hey.

189
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,389
Have it.

190
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,225
That's yours.

191
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,144
I don't want it.

192
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,270
Why not?

193
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,855
It's really tasty.

194
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,273
I said I don't want it.

195
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,400
No, have a bite at least.

196
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,277
-Try it!
-I said no!

197
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,823
{\an8}H-How mean!

198
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,284
{\an8}Why did she have
to draw blood in this situation?

199
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,620
Just leave her be.
She'll eat when she's hungry.

200
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,290
Why don't you want it?

201
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,833
Because it's a monster.

202
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,044
Everyone says that, but how is it
different from eating animals?

203
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,715
If you eat monsters, you catch
strange diseases and turn into one!

204
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,799
That's why I won't eat it!

205
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,720
If eating monsters turned you into them,
it would be a simple story.

206
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,598
It's the idea of becoming impure.

207
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,766
It's not exactly logical,

208
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,187
but I think most people, myself included,
avoid them for that reason.

209
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,440
It feels like you're absorbing
something bad in some way.

210
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,819
{\an8}And with new diseases popping up
from creatures close to humans,

211
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,448
{\an8}I don't think vague aversion
should be brushed off so lightly.

212
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,785
This is really good!

213
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:12,708
{\an8}But what did you do before
when you were served food you didn't like?

214
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,793
Before?

215
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,339
Ugh!

216
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,968
Tade, you can have this.

217
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,722
Thanks, Izu... I mean, Asebi!

218
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,432
It never happened.

219
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't believe you.

220
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,227
Let's go, you two!

221
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,740
The blizzard doesn't seem to be easing up.

222
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,535
Maybe we should just camp here for today.

223
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,869
I'm hungry too.

224
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,664
Senshi looks worn out as well.

225
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,749
Let's whip something up ourselves.

226
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,126
What ingredients do we have left?

227
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,170
Nightmares, Mandrakes,

228
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,588
eggs, mushrooms, and...

229
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,506
What's this?

230
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,049
Any fish?

231
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,551
No, no more fish.

232
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,718
Rice then.

233
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,263
We're running low on rice too.

234
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,932
Don't you have anything better than this?

235
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,141
This is all we've got.

236
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,018
Liar! You're hiding stuff!

237
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,980
You can't afford to be
a picky eater in the dungeon.

238
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,648
You should get used to it quickly.

239
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,566
No!

240
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,401
I only eat what I want to eat!

241
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,069
{\an8}Listen, Izutsumi.

242
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,405
{\an8}Eating monsters doesn't turn you into one.

243
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,534
<i>Has anyone turned into a sheep
or pig after eating them?</i>

244
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,996
<i>If a blind person eats an eyeball,
does that mean they'll see again?</i>

245
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,416
<i>Sheep only eat grass,
but do they turn into plants?</i>

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,336
Food and nutrition
are more complex than that.

247
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,672
That's why people work hard to experiment.

248
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,923
{\an8}Shut up!

249
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,259
What do you call that then?

250
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,176
That?

251
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,641
A sheep is growing into a tree.

252
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,560
It's a Barometz.

253
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,229
Why did it have to show up now?

254
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,731
Listen, Izutsumi.

255
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,232
That's a plant that always...

256
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,735
Shut up! I'm sick of your talk!

257
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,861
That's it.

258
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,738
I'm going to get that sheep.

259
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,114
{\an8}What's a Barometz?

260
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,574
{\an8}Is it some kind of monster?

261
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,993
{\an8}It's a monster all right,
but it's harmless.

262
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,994
{\an8}Although,

263
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,955
they do tend to attract carnivores.

264
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,666
Be careful, Izutsumi.

265
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,126
<i>Who does he think he's talking to?</i>

266
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,505
{\an8}It's not safe to stay here.

267
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,633
{\an8}-Let's harvest it quickly and...
-They're here.

268
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,634
Huh?

269
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,473
Dammit. Dire Wolves!

270
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,897
M-My staff!

271
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,028
Hold up!

272
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,529
Where are you going?

273
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,114
I hate dogs.

274
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,991
They're smelly, noisy, and persistent.

275
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,495
I-Is that reason enough
to just go off on your own?

276
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,705
I left you guys to deal with them.

277
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,960
You guys said friends are supposed
to make up for each other.

278
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,046
{\an8}That's not quite what we meant.

279
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,339
Then what did you mean?

280
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,300
You didn't join in on the fight
with the Golem back there.

281
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,886
It's true we left that to you,

282
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,805
but not because of personal preferences.

283
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,808
Hey, let's turn back.

284
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,059
No.

285
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,229
<i>I'm catching a whiff of fire in the wind.</i>

286
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,314
<i>If I follow it, I can find my way back.</i>

287
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,067
Wait!

288
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,196
<i>The scent's stronger to the right,</i>

289
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,699
<i>but the path looks rough,
so I'll go this way.</i>

290
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,951
Where are you heading?
Is this the right way?

291
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,620
I'll take the path I want.

292
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,580
You should do the same.

293
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,208
Why don't you do as you like more?

294
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,918
You hate eating monsters,

295
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,212
and yet you still do it.

296
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,131
It doesn't make sense.

297
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,716
{\an8}Well...

298
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,845
It seems the wolves have come after us.

299
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,096
Should we fight them here?

300
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,557
I can use explosive spells,

301
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,517
but I don't have my staff with me.

302
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,644
And it's risky to cast them
in such a confined space.

303
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,855
Maybe I can stun them with a bright light.

304
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,523
I'll run and shake them off.

305
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,237
What?!

306
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,378
Ow!

307
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,590
Owie.

308
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,633
Ow.

309
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,220
Hey, Asebi!

310
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,892
You made Tade clear off the snow
from the roof of the training hall.

311
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,893
I didn't.

312
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,352
Don't lie to me!

313
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,646
She fell from the roof while doing it.

314
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,232
Unlike you, she's clumsy,

315
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,777
so don't push tasks you dislike onto her!

316
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,112
You should show more gratitude to us
for taking you in.

317
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,242
Hey, Tade.

318
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,537
Why did you go and do something
I never asked you to do?

319
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,663
You really are dumb.

320
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,583
But Tade...

321
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,338
<i>What was it she said that day?</i>

322
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,298
Never mind.

323
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,721
<i>I slipped up.</i>

324
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,265
<i>The explosion shifted
the wind's direction,</i>

325
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,725
<i>and I failed to notice.</i>

326
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,690
Close... your eyes.

327
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,402
{\an8}Close your eyes.

328
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,780
{\an8}Close them!

329
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,997
T-Too close!

330
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,757
Izutsumi!

331
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,759
Are you alive?

332
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,803
Ow!

333
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,179
Your arm is broken.

334
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,347
Can you walk?

335
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,849
Let's rejoin the others.

336
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,023
Listen.

337
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,777
{\an8}You asked me why I eat monsters,

338
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,363
and I've been thinking about it.

339
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,032
I have my goals and objectives.

340
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,701
I want to help my friend

341
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,036
and learn more about magic.

342
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,082
So, I'm pushing toward those goals.

343
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,501
Along the way,
I encounter things I dislike.

344
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,504
Things that are bothersome,
things that tire me,

345
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,756
and having to eat things I'd rather not.

346
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,093
Individually, none of it is a big deal.

347
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,763
But if I avoid everything I dislike,

348
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,099
I'll stray further and further
from my path.

349
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,227
Just like what's happening to us now.

350
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,857
Why did you choose
to come along with us, Izutsumi?

351
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,819
Because you said that
if we met the lunatic magician,

352
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,405
there might be a chance
to break the curse on me.

353
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,364
It's this way!

354
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,033
Exactly.

355
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,077
That's why you need to be ready
to take a few shortcuts.

356
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,711
Izutsumi! Marcille!

357
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,837
Are you okay?

358
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,048
What about you guys?

359
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,342
We were in a bit of a fix,

360
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,929
<i>but Laios managed to scare them off,
so we're safe.</i>

361
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,098
<i>Most of the wolves
went after Marcille, anyway.</i>

362
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,059
Are you hurt?

363
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,769
It seems she broke her arm.

364
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,646
I'll use recovery magic on her

365
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,773
while I set it back into place,
so lend me a hand.

366
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,864
{\an8}You did great.

367
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,367
{\an8}The recovery magic hurt more.

368
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,036
I was hoping to harvest a Barometz,

369
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,081
but the wolves made off
with the mature one.

370
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,251
All that was left was this unripe fruit.

371
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,962
Let's try cooking it.

372
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,180
There's a sheep inside the fruit.

373
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,348
I can't eat that!

374
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,101
It's not the same as the others,
ethically speaking. I can't eat that!

375
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,018
Yuck.

376
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,772
Slice the Barometz ribs
into appropriate sizes,

377
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,275
season them, and cook them.

378
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,528
When both sides are nicely browned,

379
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,906
pour in some wine,
cover with a lid, and let them steam.

380
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,827
Run the rind of the fruit
through hot water, remove the peel,

381
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,412
then chop it into chunks.

382
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,164
Add garlic and stew together.

383
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,918
Pour the finished sauce over the meat,

384
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,420
and it's done.

385
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,922
BAROMETZ BALUT (OR BAROMETZ CHOPS)

386
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,924
Here, cat girl.

387
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,259
This is yours.

388
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,970
It's got weird stuff in it.

389
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,265
That's the Barometz skin and shoots.

390
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,311
You should've grilled the meat on its own.

391
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,946
Barometz might look just like sheep,

392
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,823
but they taste like crab!

393
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,033
<i>So what?</i>

394
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,201
<i>It's delicious.</i>

395
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,829
<i>I never knew food this amazing existed.</i>

396
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,332
<i>Come to think of it...</i>

397
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,711
Tade, why did you go and do something
I never asked you to do?

398
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,629
You really are dumb.

399
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,673
Tade just wants

400
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,010
to be helpful to everyone.

401
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,094
Ow!

402
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,388
I mean, this place is pretty great.

403
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,350
We get three meals,
warm bedding, and baths too.

404
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,895
I can't risk being kicked out.

405
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,606
I'll do chores and anything else
to show them I'm useful!

406
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,692
Asebi,

407
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,863
{\an8}don't lose your way just because
something is a bit bothersome.

408
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,536
{\an8}And Lady Maizuru sometimes
rewards me with snacks.

409
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,705
{\an8}That's what you're truly after, isn't it?

410
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,333
<i>Maybe she's right.</i>

411
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,669
<i>Sometimes you do end up
with something tasty out of it.</i>

412
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,675
Good for you, Izutsumi!

413
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,136
-Well done! Good girl!
-Good girl.

414
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,097
{\an8}Cut it out... You...

415
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,725
{\an8}What do you take me for, huh?!

416
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,812
I'll only eat when I have no other choice.

417
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,606
I won't be eating any vegetables
or monsters that taste bad, got it?

418
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,110
But you won't know if they taste bad
until you give them a try.

419
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,238
By the way, Marcille,
I noticed you're barely eating.

420
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,657
Do you really think
you can get away with not eating

421
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,617
after giving me that lecture?

422
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:36,081
<i>Marcille deeply regretted
blocking her own means of escape.</i>

423
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,500
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

424
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,002
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

425
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,968
