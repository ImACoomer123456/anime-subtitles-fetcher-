1
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,689
I'm back, Mom.

3
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,735
What's that?

4
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,237
It smells great.

5
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,949
That's because it's your birthday.

6
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,535
{\an8}It's all your favorite dishes.

7
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,787
Wow, really?

8
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,705
Time to eat up.

9
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,209
See? These are all your favorite...

10
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,212
ingredients from the dungeon.

11
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,467
What's wrong, Marcille?

12
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,137
I had a nightmare.

13
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,308
What's with this smell?

14
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,060
It's the same as in my dream.

15
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,896
Another party is making
breakfast over there.

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,190
They're grilling cured pork

17
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,733
and eating it.

18
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,235
I'm so jealous.

19
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,945
How truly terrible.

20
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,947
It's just so tragic.

21
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,031
100 PERSON SURVEY
ON DUNGEON MEALS

22
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,368
When it comes to meals
eaten by young adventurers nowadays,

23
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,288
they have bread, dried meat, and wine.

24
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,457
To build up stamina
for exploring the dungeon,

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,293
fat from meats is important.

26
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,044
But that alone is not enough.

27
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,214
Malnutrition is more terrifying
than monsters.

28
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,967
This may sound like a lecture,

29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,471
but that doesn't mean
our meals are perfect either.

30
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:05,476
The young elven girl says
she's jealous of their pork,

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,396
but that's because her body wants fat.

32
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,231
I just don't want to eat monsters!

33
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,233
And so,

34
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,236
we'll hunt monsters high in fat today.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,822
If we can find eggs, that's even better.

36
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,824
Eggs have all the nutrition you need.

37
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,243
We should proactively harvest them
in the dungeon.

38
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,038
{\an8}Are you thinking...

39
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,122
{\an8}Yeah, I am.

40
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,248
{\an8}What is it?

41
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,292
<i>The body of a chicken.</i>

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,169
<i>The tail of a snake.</i>

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,131
<i>A creature said to possess deadly venom
in its fangs and claws.</i>

44
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,800
<i>The Basilisk, king of snakes.</i>

45
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
Oh, a Basilisk.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
Isn't that great, Marcille?

47
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,765
You'll get to eat chicken.

48
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,478
Is that chicken?
Does that really count as chicken?

49
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,563
Isn't it so cool?

50
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,775
I used to think it was cooler
when more species are mixed together.

51
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:58,363
But with only two types,
they bring out each other's strengths.

52
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:02,700
I even noticed the beauty of chicken,
something I used to only see as poultry.

53
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,245
It's a simple yet profound combination.

54
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,748
By the way, the Cockatrice
that nests deeper inside

55
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,000
is another kind of snake-tailed animal.

56
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,420
I've always dreamed
of comparing its taste with a Basilisk's.

57
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,381
Why would anyone want that?

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,592
That area is a Basilisk nest.

59
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,012
There it is.

60
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,598
Looks like they're freshly laid.

61
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,768
Let's snatch them up
while their mother's gone.

62
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,436
They're so long and narrow.

63
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,354
Hold this.

64
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,731
It's so soft.

65
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,109
A Basilisk cry.

66
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,652
Let's hurry, Senshi.

67
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,238
Wait, we got to wrap this in cloth.

68
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,909
It's the party from earlier.

69
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,731
That's the worst way to run away.

70
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,899
She's basically begging
to get her back kicked.

71
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,318
Go and save her already!

72
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,996
Spread your arms and legs out
to make your body look as big as possible

73
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,748
and make loud sounds to intimidate it.

74
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,751
That'll stop it from coming any further!

75
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,756
I want to pretend that
I'm not associated with him.

76
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,974
<i>Basilisks also have a head on their tail.</i>

77
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,227
<i>It doesn't seem to have a blind spot,
but it only has one body.</i>

78
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>If you bait the heads with an attack
from two different directions,</i>

79
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,982
<i>the two brains will confuse the body...</i>

80
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,693
<i>for a single moment.</i>

81
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,574
How are his wounds?

82
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,493
Was he poisoned?

83
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,994
-Y-Yes.
-Laios.

84
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,663
Senshi says he has an antidote.

85
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,998
Really?

86
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,251
I want to use it in today's cooking.

87
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,003
-What?!
-What?!

88
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,255
But this guy's hanging on by a thread!

89
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,674
Instead of taking the antidote alone,

90
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,009
it's tastier when cooked.

91
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,636
{\an8}Then cook it already!

92
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,806
<i>First, cut off the tail and feet.</i>

93
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,892
<i>Blanch it a bit and pluck its feathers.</i>

94
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,271
It's chicken now.

95
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,691
<i>Take its innards out
and rub your spices on it.</i>

96
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,320
<i>Stuff it with veggies
and finely chopped herbs</i>

97
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,072
<i>and tie up the opening.</i>

98
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,491
<i>Put a skewer through the meat</i>

99
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,576
<i>and roast it thoroughly.</i>

100
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,078
It's done.

101
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,038
Hurry, feed it to him.

102
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,588
The meat's overflowing with juices.
It's delicious.

103
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,090
Sorry about all that.

104
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,300
You all should eat too.

105
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,468
Hold on.

106
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,345
I got to cast a healing spell first...

107
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:16,269
This is so good!
I could see this at a restaurant in town.

108
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,604
It tastes exactly like chicken.

109
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,232
I heard snake meat
is similar to chicken too.

110
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,820
Sorry, I'll cast my healing spell now.

111
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:26,737
Oops, wrong item.

112
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,869
I've never had a proper meal
like this before in a dungeon.

113
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,164
Um...

114
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,127
It's been three months
since we started challenging this dungeon,

115
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,630
but we keep getting wiped out
at the same place.

116
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:50,136
{\an8}How do we become strong enough
to cook monsters like you all?

117
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,054
Well, that's...

118
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,265
First, improve your diet.

119
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,267
Rethink your circadian rhythm.

120
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,269
And engage in proper exercise.

121
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,897
If you pay attention to
these three things,

122
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,649
your body will naturally get stronger.

123
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,862
<i>What incredible people.</i>

124
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,114
Let's do our best too.

125
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,122
Reaching the third floor today
might be impossible.

126
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,708
It's because we took
our sweet time on that roast.

127
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,378
Apparently, the Red Dragon wakes up
once a month to go hunting.

128
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,798
That was probably
when we ran into it the other day.

129
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,968
Then he's sleeping on a full stomach now.

130
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,305
I'd like to find him
before he gets an empty stomach.

131
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,224
That's why, Marcille,

132
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,434
it'd be great
if we could move things along.

133
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,690
Won't be easy at this rate.

134
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,235
I'm totally fine.

135
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,237
I can easily walk more.

136
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,321
Don't push yourself.

137
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,572
Let's rest a bit.

138
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,907
I'm not pushing myself!

139
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,033
Hey, listen.

140
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,410
If you try to act tough now,

141
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,164
you'll just hurt yourself
and become a burden, got it?

142
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,916
SHOCK

143
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,835
It might be easier
to use a different path.

144
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,088
But the Big Bat outside
will be in our way.

145
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,007
I can use magic on the Big Bats.

146
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,259
No, that's okay.

147
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,594
What about a secret passageway?

148
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,680
More traps, but fewer monsters.

149
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,431
I have trap-disarming spells...

150
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,101
It's faster if Chilchuck disarms them.

151
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,313
We're taking a path
with fewer monsters, huh?

152
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,983
We should secure some foodstuffs then.

153
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,402
Can't we get by on today's leftovers?

154
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,903
We only have meat and eggs.

155
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,738
We need vegetables.

156
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,324
There's a Mandrake colony near here.

157
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,245
Me! I know how to harvest Mandrakes!

158
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,496
Leave it to me!

159
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,667
Mandrakes are fundamental
in magic and medicine.

160
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,128
In other words, my area of expertise.

161
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,672
Everyone, listen to me this time.

162
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,675
Mandrakes scream
when you pull them from the dirt.

163
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,678
It'll make you go insane
or even cause death.

164
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,347
We would get wiped out

165
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,601
and be one step further from saving Falin.

166
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,436
To prevent that...

167
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,273
First, we need a string
and a well-trained dog.

168
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,190
A dog?

169
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,945
We'll tie the Mandrake to the dog's collar
and call the dog over from a distance.

170
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,781
Then, the Mandrake
will be pulled out by the dog.

171
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,867
What'll happen to the dog?

172
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,869
It'll die.

173
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,120
That's awful.

174
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,163
But also,

175
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,123
where are we going to get a dog?

176
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,793
And that method
doesn't seem very efficient.

177
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,712
But at school, we...

178
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,881
Can't we use a long string?

179
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,798
Huh?

180
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,635
Use a string so long
that we won't hear it scream.

181
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,470
Then we won't need a dog.

182
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:38,971
What?

183
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm pretty sure we can't.

184
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,851
Maybe because it's hard to pull?

185
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,943
That scared me.

186
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,695
Was that Marcille?

187
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,908
It won't scream
if you cut its head off beforehand.

188
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,242
That's true.

189
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,078
No, that's too dangerous.

190
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,330
That's how I've eaten them for many years.

191
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,416
That kind of novice mentality
brings the most danger.

192
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,252
But Senshi actually has experience.

193
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,173
Have you ever tried
the method according to the book?

194
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,676
<i>No. I feel so bad for the dog.</i>

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,180
Either way, we don't have a dog
nor the time for this.

196
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,682
Sorry, but let's learn how Senshi does it.

197
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,102
<i>If it were that easy,</i>

198
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,687
<i>you'd think it'd be written
in the handbook.</i>

199
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>But he's right.</i>

200
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,109
<i>It's not convincing
when I'm only reading from a book.</i>

201
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,694
<i>I shouldn't have them do
something I haven't tried myself.</i>

202
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,697
<i>Something I haven't tried?</i>

203
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,200
<i>Then I'll just have to show them.</i>

204
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,203
<i>I'll prove that my method makes sense.</i>

205
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,038
I'm sorry, Marcille!

206
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,206
I forgive you.

207
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,126
<i>But since I can't use a dog...</i>

208
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,460
<i>A monster!</i>

209
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,880
<i>The monsters in this area are Big Bats.</i>

210
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,966
<i>They should be asleep right now.</i>

211
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,303
<i>I wonder if this will work.</i>

212
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,472
<i>It didn't say how hard you have to pull.</i>

213
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,309
<i>Big Bat nests can be found
through their droppings.</i>

214
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,396
<i>Laios's library of knowledge
is actually coming in handy.</i>

215
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,983
<i>And a place
you can't hear the screams from</i>

216
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,693
<i>would be that tower.</i>

217
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,910
Focus on the target...

218
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,666
<i>Aire Faum Orbis!</i>

219
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,760
All right!

220
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,474
What's that?

221
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,641
Marcille?

222
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,358
Wait.

223
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,902
Wait...

224
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,654
<i>It really is important
to try things first.</i>

225
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>If anything,</i>

226
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,035
<i>now I know why Big Bats
shouldn't be used to replace dogs.</i>

227
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,038
Marcille!

228
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,081
Did she die?

229
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,211
She's alive.

230
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,132
Using a Big Bat instead of a dog?

231
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,300
What an idiot.

232
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,721
Hey, Marcille. Can you hear me?

233
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,724
Yes, I am very well.

234
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,975
No, you're not.

235
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,644
She heard the scream.

236
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,062
Let's keep talking with her.

237
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,064
She'll slowly snap out of it.

238
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,566
Why did you do this?

239
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,027
I panicked when I was told
I'd be a burden,

240
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,945
No wait...

241
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,740
...so I wanted to stick it to you guys
and make you bow down to me.

242
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,991
What the heck?

243
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,076
Chilchuck.

244
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,956
I felt alone since I couldn't be
of help to everyone.

245
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,878
The monsters get stronger
as we go deeper into the dungeon.

246
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,631
The thing I can depend on most
is your magic,

247
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,301
so I didn't want to use it up
on such an early floor.

248
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,846
And everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

249
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,558
I want to rely on your strengths.

250
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,477
Someone else will cover
for your weaknesses.

251
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,730
You can depend on us more.

252
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,985
Tell her, Chilchuck.

253
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:26,740
I really think having you here with us
is a huge help.

254
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,247
Put more feeling into it.

255
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,000
When did you get back to normal?!

256
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,254
I didn't expect a Big Bat too.
What a surprising catch.

257
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,506
How about we make some omelets today?

258
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,343
Is this really a Basilisk egg?

259
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,762
It's completely different
from chicken eggs.

260
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,598
That's how snake eggs are.

261
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,683
Only its tail was a snake.

262
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,643
Its head and body were a chicken.

263
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,812
No, the tail was a chicken.

264
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,147
BODY, TAIL

265
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,901
The color on this one
is different from the rest.

266
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,277
You're right.

267
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,280
Marcille got that one
since it still has a head.

268
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,745
<i>Chop up the Mandrake and sauté it well.</i>

269
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,247
<i>Cover it with the egg.</i>

270
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,541
<i>Once it fluffs up...</i>

271
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,876
It's done.

272
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,545
MANDRAKE AND BASILISK OMELET

273
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,214
The yellow is
way darker than a chicken egg.

274
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,884
This is the Mandrake we harvested.

275
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,554
This one uses the Mandrake
harvested by the elven girl.

276
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,140
You shouldn't rub salt in someone's wound.

277
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,058
Now, now.

278
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,731
Marcille's isn't bitter,
and it has a mild taste.

279
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,399
Yeah, it's delicious.

280
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,070
The screaming must have gotten
the bitterness out.

281
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,907
It's basic cooking knowledge
that going the extra mile improves a dish.

282
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,910
It seems I only sought efficiency

283
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,162
and lost sight of what truly matters.

284
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,914
Thank you, Marcille.

285
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,833
Your knowledge and book are superb.

286
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,752
This isn't a cookbook, you know.

287
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,838
Take this small gift as my thanks.

288
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,424
You can have the most delicious part.

289
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,346
I don't want it!

290
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,684
I'm sick and tired of eating monsters!

291
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,272
Is the shortcut entrance around here?

292
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,273
The entrance?

293
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,192
Laios, give me your sword.

294
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,283
It's here.

295
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,832
What just happened?

296
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,377
Chilchuck is an expert
in detecting traps and picking locks.

297
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,755
Just so you know,
there will be traps everywhere,

298
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,924
so don't do anything unless I tell you to.

299
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,054
What I hate the most

300
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,557
are those who get in the way of my work.

301
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,026
Hold it.

302
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,793
These tiles are safe to step on.

303
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,179
What the heck was that?

304
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,890
I told you to only step
where I told you to.

305
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,642
Your foot's sticking out by so much.

306
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,519
I don't like complicated stuff.

307
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,104
Who cares what you like?

308
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,398
You've got to be more careful.

309
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,194
Some traps are connected
and affect other traps.

310
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,405
If one thing shifts,
all my calculations go out the window.

311
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,658
Just move wherever I tell you to.

312
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,545
Such firepower.

313
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,463
I see.

314
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,465
Traps come in many shapes and forms.

315
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,008
Move your foot already.

316
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,261
Fire traps usually come
as a set with gas or oil.

317
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,179
Oil.

318
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,306
We don't need a dwarf roast.

319
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:20,933
A roast.

320
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,851
No, wait.

321
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,853
Deep-fried food.

322
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,938
Fried.

323
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,273
<i>Kakiage</i>!

324
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,652
We'll have tempura for lunch today.

325
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,613
Where's the oil trap?

326
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,490
It's not meant for cooking.

327
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,283
Half-foot child.

328
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,619
You are no expert on oil.

329
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,496
I'm not a child.

330
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,791
Vegetable oil is simple
and the highest in supply.

331
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,459
Anyhow, show me the oil.

332
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,962
I'll give up
if it isn't meant for cooking.

333
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,507
Fine.

334
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,883
In exchange,

335
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,387
promise you'll follow
my orders around the traps.

336
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,141
{\an8}I won't help you
if you don't accept this condition.

337
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,184
I swear it.

338
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,936
I'll help too, if needed.

339
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,146
I won't need it.

340
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,272
{\an8}Listen.

341
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,274
{\an8}We each have our own job.

342
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,277
{\an8}Yours is cooking.
Mine is detecting traps and picking locks.

343
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,154
Marcille's is magic.

344
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,240
I don't say anything
about your cooking methods.

345
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,743
So, please stop interfering with my work.

346
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,874
The treasure vault.

347
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,794
The excessive number of traps here
must be to keep out intruders.

348
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,923
They're secured onto the ground.

349
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,593
I guess I'll try opening one.

350
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,804
Go over there.

351
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,683
He's usually the most mature one.

352
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,686
Having his companions' lives in his hands

353
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,439
is probably putting him on edge.

354
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,609
It's open.

355
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,112
I see. How do we get the oil out?

356
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,572
I don't know.

357
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,116
This is the spout.

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,370
Pulling this trigger will release the oil,
but I don't know how much.

359
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,581
I'll have my pot ready then.

360
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,249
Pull the trigger.

361
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,168
No way.

362
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,753
It's probably boiling oil.

363
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,129
Don't be afraid.

364
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,255
I <i>am</i> afraid.

365
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,135
Don't come crying to me later!

366
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,932
So hot!

367
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,226
I told you so.

368
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,436
Are you okay, Senshi?

369
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,812
Your finger's in it!

370
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,691
It's 180 degrees. Perfect for frying food.

371
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,653
You're the type that's okay with heat?

372
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,573
The smell and taste
tell me that it's olive oil.

373
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,574
For real?

374
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,827
They do say this area
originally produced olives.

375
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,330
It's not surprising
that it's used in traps.

376
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,208
You think so?

377
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,543
Either way, I can fry food with this.

378
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,461
Oh, right!

379
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,923
Can we use the blade
from the trap earlier to cut the meat?

380
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,093
No, we don't know
if it'll fall in the exact same place.

381
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,388
I'll leave it to you.

382
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,391
After all, I don't know
how to handle the traps.

383
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,226
Why should I?

384
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,522
Cooking is my job,
so you should follow my directions.

385
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,233
I believe that was our deal.

386
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
I never said that.

387
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,413
<i>What am I doing?</i>

388
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,833
I cut the Big Bat.

389
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,750
Okay.

390
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,380
Next, go heat up this oil
at the fire trap from earlier.

391
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,966
What's wrong? Hurry along.

392
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,724
<i>Cut off the Big Bat's thick outer layer
and chop the meat into chunks.</i>

393
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>Lightly score the meat,</i>

394
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,894
<i>massage the seasoning in, and let it rest.</i>

395
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,273
<i>Meanwhile, let's prepare
the Mandrake</i> kakiage.

396
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,526
<i>When you peel the Mandrake skin,</i>

397
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,445
<i>it's best to pull the limbs off first.</i>

398
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>You can tear them off by hand
if you unravel them.</i>

399
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,532
<i>Completely peel the body</i>

400
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,869
<i>and lightly scrape
the darker parts off the limbs.</i>

401
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,787
<i>Then, we prepare the batter.</i>

402
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,749
<i>Mix a Basilisk egg into the water</i>

403
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,709
<i>and sift flour into the mixture.</i>

404
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,627
<i>Avoid clumps while mixing it</i>

405
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,671
<i>and put the Mandrake in.</i>

406
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,965
How's the fire going?

407
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,300
How would I know?

408
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,386
I've never had to adjust
a trap's firepower before, darn it.

409
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,223
Looks just right.

410
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,148
When it looks like
it won't fall apart, flip it.

411
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,149
Got it?

412
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,317
Okay.

413
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,906
Is it ready?

414
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,950
Dang it. It was too soon.

415
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,911
Maybe the fire's too weak.

416
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,749
It burned.

417
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,250
How's it looking?

418
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,294
It's going horribly.
Can you take it from here?

419
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,921
The fire trap is your job.

420
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,549
I can adjust the fire,
but isn't frying part of your job?

421
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,718
It turns gooey if the fire is weak,

422
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,012
but it burns if it's too strong.

423
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,224
That must mean
it's not a trap-related issue, huh?

424
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,267
Looks almost ready.

425
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,813
The color turned out nicely.

426
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,273
It's done.

427
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,275
MANDRAKE AND BIG BAT KAKIAGE

428
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,154
I never imagined I could eat
fried food in a dungeon like this.

429
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,407
It's fried really well.

430
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,076
We had a good firepower.

431
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,079
You must aim to fry food quickly
with the right temperature.

432
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,622
It gets nice and crispy.

433
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:39,000
That's pretty hard to do
with an open fire.

434
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,628
I don't think people would do this
on an open fire.

435
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:45,841
I pass by here often, but who knew
such a convenient room was here?

436
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,844
Listen up.

437
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,346
Don't try this without me here.

438
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,848
You'll die for sure.

439
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,099
I know.

440
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,519
I can never imitate
your trap manipulation skills.

441
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,146
It's truly amazing.

442
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,190
When we go our separate ways someday,

443
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,944
it's unfortunate that I won't be able
to use that trap alone.

444
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,365
I guess I have no choice.

445
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,492
When we have some spare time,

446
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,369
I'll teach you a bit about traps.

447
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,537
Are you sure?

448
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,039
I'm kind of reluctant to do so.

449
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:23,336
{\an8}But you know,
you taught me how to cook, Senshi.

450
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,132
<i>Bread cannot replace meat.</i>

451
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,467
<i>Nor can meat replace bread.</i>

452
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,429
<i>But together, they taste even better.</i>

453
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,310
<i>Both food and people remain the same.</i>

454
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,895
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

455
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,861
