1
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,847
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:43,937
No way.

3
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,189
Falin...

4
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,359
C-Could she really be resurrected
from that condition?

5
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,028
It's not unprecedented, but...

6
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,199
H-Hey, Laios.

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,992
We don't know that yet.

8
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,744
I'll take her to the resurrection office.

9
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,288
Are you planning to take the entire mass?

10
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,874
There are probably Warg bones
in there as well.

11
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,793
I can't distinguish them, so...

12
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,504
I'll help.

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,049
Wait!

14
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,178
{\an8}The bond between her soul and flesh
is very fragile right now.

15
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,763
{\an8}Moving her remains is risky.

16
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,017
<i>The greater the damage to one's flesh,
the more likely their soul is to depart.</i>

17
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,728
<i>The main reason some resurrections fail</i>

18
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,774
<i>is the soul's departure
or the incomplete restoration of the body.</i>

19
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,068
So, what do we do?

20
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,030
Bring a revivifier
and resurrect her right here.

21
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:40,994
<i>But it requires twice the calories
of the damaged parts to restore her.</i>

22
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,622
<i>They'll need to bring a substantial amount
of fresh blood and flesh along.</i>

23
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,750
{\an8}-They'll rot on their way here...
-No.

24
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,002
{\an8}What?

25
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,919
{\an8}Yes.

26
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,882
We have an abundance
of fresh blood and flesh right here.

27
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,384
W-Wait a minute!

28
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,177
Are you going to resurrect her?

29
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,304
Using dragon flesh?

30
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,931
But resurrection magic
isn't your specialty, is it?

31
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,311
I've been silent about it
because I didn't want to alarm you.

32
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:12,525
But I specialize in the study
of ancient magic that's forbidden now.

33
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,904
I think using that
is the only way we can bring her back.

34
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,406
{\an8}It's not honest magic, but still.

35
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,283
{\an8}-What?
-Black magic?

36
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,160
{\an8}Don't. No good will come of it.

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,704
{\an8}There is no good or evil in magic.

38
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,042
What do you say, Laios?

39
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,961
Do it, Marcille.

40
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,505
Bring Falin back to life.

41
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,759
Leave it to me.

42
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,968
I'll try my best.

43
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,595
Are you all out of your minds?

44
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,972
You're seriously going
to use dragon flesh?

45
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,642
Usually, they use goats or pigs.

46
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,560
It's kinda late
to start having qualms about it.

47
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,478
Marcille.

48
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,746
{\an8}Her body should be as close
to its original state as possible,

49
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,873
{\an8}so I'll start by reconstructing
her bone structure.

50
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,416
I see.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,627
I have some knowledge
of a dog's skeletal framework.

52
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,505
I'll work on putting together
a Warg's frame.

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,385
{\an8}That's not necessary, is it?

54
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,346
{\an8}It could help avoid oversights or errors!

55
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,309
Humans typically have around 200 bones.

56
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,813
So, that means
there are roughly 840 bones here.

57
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,481
Huh? That many?

58
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,609
Based on the skulls, there were two Wargs.

59
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,362
A dog's body has around 320 bones.

60
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,407
It should be easier
if we begin with the simpler bones.

61
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,368
The more rounded one is a human rib cage.

62
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,579
Next, the vertebrae
that connect with the ribs.

63
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,666
This is easy as well since the curvature
of the spine is so distinct.

64
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,295
The tricky part
is the smaller bones of the arms and legs.

65
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,256
I can't distinguish them at all.

66
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,676
Let's start sorting them out,
beginning with the prominent ones.

67
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,054
The largest bone here is the ankle bone.

68
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,683
Arrange the other large bones
in a way that fits,

69
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,269
and we have the instep of a foot.

70
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,731
Lastly, the bones of the hand.

71
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,941
Let's start by arranging the fingers.

72
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,276
I got it!

73
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,195
Like this, right?

74
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,864
Close!

75
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,075
The longest metacarpal isn't
in the middle finger

76
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,452
but in the index finger.

77
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,289
Finally, we need to find the carpal bones
that connect the fingers to her arm.

78
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,920
Give me a hint!

79
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,714
You better not be enjoying this!

80
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,469
There.

81
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,012
It's done!

82
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,473
THE BONE STRUCTURES
OF FALIN AND WARGS

83
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,725
I don't know how to put it, but...

84
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,478
they're such beautiful
skeletal frameworks.

85
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,396
{\an8}They're really nice skeletons now.

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,690
{\an8}It seems they had good calcium.

87
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,985
{\an8}This won't revive
the Wargs as well, will it?

88
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,155
The only souls confined
to the dungeon are those of humans.

89
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:08,034
Otherwise, this place would be crowded
with the souls of all sorts of creatures.

90
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,339
Well then, I'll start.

91
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>O Pilitsham.</i>

92
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,804
<i>O Esdoms. O Villaru.</i>

93
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,390
<i>Casuszameo Rotokt Artumcuks.</i>

94
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,268
<i>O Kunquikeo. Eoktum Kome.</i>

95
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:41,275
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.
Aoewauk Aentujon.</i>

96
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,237
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.</i>

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,864
<i>Aoewauk Aentujon.</i>

98
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,034
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.</i>

99
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,288
<i>Aoewauk Aentujon...</i>

100
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,707
Marcille!

101
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,920
She's unconscious.

102
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,547
What happened?

103
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,173
Did it work?

104
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:23,985
Falin!

105
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,779
Her air passage is blocked with blood.

106
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,823
Try to stay calm and spit it out.

107
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,617
You're safe now.

108
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,290
Falin.

109
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,551
Laios...

110
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,140
Thank goodness.

111
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,144
Cold...

112
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,354
Right, my armor!

113
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,607
Sorry! I'll get you something to wear!

114
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,111
Falin, are you okay?

115
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,614
Are you unhurt?

116
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,700
That's good.

117
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,202
Marcille.

118
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,953
Marcille!

119
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,165
What happened to Falin?

120
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,083
She's come back to life.

121
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,212
She still seems a bit disoriented, though.

122
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,885
Falin!

123
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,057
Thank goodness!

124
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,184
I'm so relieved!

125
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,645
Marcille...

126
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,487
Chil...

127
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,988
How's she doing?

128
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,242
She still seems to be a little confused.

129
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,369
Right. Let me introduce him.

130
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,995
This is Senshi.

131
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,248
He helped us a lot on our journey.

132
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,959
Hello, Falin.

133
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,585
It's nice to meet you.

134
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,963
Sen...

135
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,889
Let's start preparing our meal!

136
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,688
Thank goodness!

137
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,024
I'm so relieved!

138
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,818
M-Marcille.

139
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,320
I can wash myself, you know.

140
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,574
I had to make sure your skin
was restored properly.

141
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,576
It tickles!

142
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,957
You have a bruise here!

143
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,167
T-That's from when I tripped

144
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,587
and bumped my chin
on the edge of the steps as a kid.

145
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,589
Oh.

146
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,676
Marcille, you look paler than me.

147
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,345
I'm just running low on magic.

148
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,557
I'll be fine if I have something to eat
and rest a little...

149
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,354
What are you doing?

150
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,609
I just wanted to share
some of my magic with you.

151
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,569
Oh, please.

152
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,614
{\an8}You don't have enough magic
right now to share.

153
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,615
But I do.

154
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,117
I'm feeling surprisingly great.

155
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,202
There's this power welling up inside me.

156
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,206
{\an8}But it's a bit like
recovering from an illness,

157
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,168
{\an8}so hold off on using magic
until you're back on your feet, okay?

158
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,548
{\an8}I died, didn't I?

159
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,428
{\an8}I can't remember how it happened.

160
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,597
{\an8}What exactly happened?

161
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,307
{\an8}Everyone is exhausted and scarred.

162
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,268
{\an8}And why is the Red Dragon here?

163
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,729
Are Namari and Shuro safe?

164
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,775
If everyone had to push themselves
because of me, then...

165
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,360
That's not...

166
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,029
{\an8}And what's up with that magic circle?

167
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,742
It didn't look like anything good.

168
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:06,082
If I forced you
to use something like that...

169
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,293
{\an8}It's fine!

170
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,924
Sure, getting here was challenging,
and I had some rough times.

171
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,551
But now, they're all just
stories to laugh about

172
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,804
because everything worked out!

173
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,808
So, don't worry about it.

174
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,144
None of us has any regrets at all.

175
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,321
{\an8}We can erase that magic circle altogether,
and it will be fine.

176
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,199
For now...

177
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,245
our main concern is the journey back.

178
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,622
What should we do about your clothes?

179
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,083
And I have to wash and dry mine.

180
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,961
Honestly, if it weren't for those frogs...

181
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,462
Frogs?

182
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,465
What's the plan now?

183
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,968
Head back to the surface.

184
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,721
We can't use return magic
or the Orcs' secret passage anymore.

185
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,141
We'll have to take the main road
back to the castle.

186
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
That's not what I meant.

187
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,980
{\an8}Even though you've rescued your sister,
you're still penniless.

188
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,899
{\an8}I do have some savings in the bank.

189
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,818
{\an8}But you don't have a token, right?

190
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,279
{\an8}And to get it reissued,
it'll take a month.

191
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,364
{\an8}That's the predicament.

192
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,701
{\an8}Anyway, Marcille, that girl!

193
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,202
{\an8}Did you know, Laios?

194
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,163
{\an8}That she could use black magic?

195
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,832
{\an8}She never shared many details,

196
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,252
{\an8}but she mentioned wanting
to explore the dungeon for her studies.

197
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,004
{\an8}I thought it was odd.

198
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:39,508
Why would an elf who doesn't seem
to be desperate venture into the dungeon?

199
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,011
She's not one of those dark elves, is she?

200
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,847
I hope this won't lead to any trouble.

201
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,893
Who are you calling a dark elf?

202
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,147
{\an8}I-I mean, if it was harmless,
it wouldn't be forbidden, right?

203
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,398
Harmless?

204
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,901
Even recovery magic
can be used for torture.

205
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,945
Just like a blade,
it depends on how you use it.

206
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,407
I study forbidden arts to benefit people.

207
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,160
I have nothing to feel guilty about.

208
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,080
{\an8}But concerning the method
of resurrection I used,

209
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,583
{\an8}it's best for all of us
to forget about it.

210
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,418
{\an8}So you do feel guilty about it!

211
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,421
Oh, well. Never mind.

212
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,131
It's all in the past now.

213
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,425
By the way...

214
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,933
<i>Where's Senshi?</i>

215
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,809
Preparing the dragon meat, I imagine.

216
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,856
I just passed Mr. Senshi
carrying a pot and some firewood.

217
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,024
What did I tell you?

218
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,317
He's getting ready to cook.

219
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,694
Cook...

220
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,446
Near the dragon?

221
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,200
-This is bad!
-This is bad!

222
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,660
What's wrong?

223
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,995
When we opened up the dragon,
we opened its fuel bag, too.

224
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,289
If he starts a fire there now...

225
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,334
Senshi!

226
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,710
Stop!

227
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,963
Senshi!

228
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,147
W-We're alive.

229
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,650
Is this defense magic?

230
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,407
Falin, did you do this?

231
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,158
It seems so.

232
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,243
In that split second?

233
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,411
Without chanting?

234
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,413
I don't know.

235
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,916
I just felt I had to protect everyone and...

236
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,419
That's amazing.

237
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,130
Kind of like an adrenaline rush, huh?

238
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,258
If only we had that power
during the fight with the Red Dragon.

239
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,178
A-Anyway, you've just been revived,

240
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,556
so hold off on using any more magic, okay?

241
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,933
That took me by surprise.

242
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,312
I told you dragons breathe fire
with their self-made fuel, right?

243
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,564
Your fire ignited that fuel.

244
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,774
It won't go out.

245
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,277
The fat in its body is burning.

246
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,570
It'll eventually go out.

247
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,240
Until then,
I won't be able to get its meat.

248
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,576
What a pickle.

249
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,664
Maybe I could use that for cooking.

250
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,836
Combine flour, yeast, salt,
and water, and knead well.

251
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,588
Let it rest for a while and...

252
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,089
In the meantime, go take a bath.

253
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,593
Stretch and shape the dough,

254
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,595
then add toppings to it.

255
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,098
Sprinkle flour on the dragon's skin,

256
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,101
then, put them inside the dragon.

257
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,854
Cut off the tip of the tail.

258
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,856
What a waste!

259
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,859
Peel the skin and use it to make a soup.

260
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:49,990
Cut the meat into blocks and sear
on the hot dragon scales until golden.

261
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,992
Then, marinate in sauce.

262
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,247
It's done!

263
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,540
DRAGON TAIL SOUP

264
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,502
ONION PIZZA, ROAST RED DRAGON

265
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,254
Looks so good!

266
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,840
Can we eat it?

267
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,217
-Of course, not!
-Of course, not!

268
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,269
It's delicious!

269
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,272
It feels like the first meal
I had in a long time.

270
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,190
Good!

271
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,234
It's your turn to eat your fill of it.

272
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,694
Oh, well.

273
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,737
She seems to be enjoying it, so.

274
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,582
It's really chewy,
but the taste is oddly familiar.

275
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,002
What is this taste?

276
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,045
It's not quite like beef or pork, though.

277
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,923
And this flavor reminds me...

278
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,759
a little of Living Armor, don't you think?

279
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,927
Does it?

280
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,805
It doesn't have that rusty smell, though.

281
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,142
And the Kelpie and frog meat
were more tender.

282
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,185
If anything, it's a bit like the Basilisk.

283
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,062
What do you think, Laios?

284
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,067
I don't know what you're all on about.

285
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,318
This vibrant red!

286
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,070
This firmness!

287
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,822
This rich taste!

288
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,575
Each characteristic is like no other!

289
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,454
Why compare the taste of dragon
with other creatures in the first place?

290
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,207
This is the taste of a dragon!

291
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,756
{\an8}Um, Falin.

292
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,467
{\an8}You might have
already figured this out, but...

293
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,970
We couldn't afford to buy food,
so we made it this far by eating monsters.

294
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,599
That's amazing.

295
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,976
That's amazing!

296
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,770
What monsters did you eat?

297
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,022
H-How did you prepare them?

298
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,565
Seems like we didn't have to worry.

299
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,317
This is exactly what I was afraid of!

300
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,694
First, we had a Huge Scorpion and a Slime.

301
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,072
We even tried a Walking Mushroom.

302
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,531
A Walking Mushroom?

303
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,618
We even harvested vegetables from Golems.

304
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,454
What about a Fish-man?

305
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,748
We didn't try that.

306
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,750
But we did eat Living Armor.

307
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,752
What?! What part did you eat?

308
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:13,300
Um, it's actually a colony of mollusks
wearing a shell and...

309
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,178
Wouldn't it be simpler
to just show her the real thing?

310
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,600
What's this?

311
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,691
{\an8}Why didn't you tell us about it?!

312
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,984
{\an8}Sorry.

313
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,404
It's cute. Is it a pulmonata?

314
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,785
It went back inside.

315
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,124
It moves on its own.

316
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,750
Seriously?

317
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,668
My bad.

318
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,797
I planned to keep it temporarily
until I found another weapon at first.

319
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,424
But I kept it because
of its useful reactions to other monsters.

320
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,469
{\an8}So that's how you showed
really sharp instincts now and then!

321
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,638
{\an8}We should've gotten Namari to examine it.

322
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:03,809
In that situation, I agree
you had no choice but to use the sword.

323
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,561
But it shouldn't have been
a solo decision.

324
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,606
The greatest damage
is the loss of trust from your teammates.

325
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,358
It was careless of me.

326
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,860
It won't happen again.

327
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,820
So, what will you do with it?

328
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,322
Until I find another weapon,
I'd like to keep using it.

329
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,492
<i>I could dunk it in water
and drown the creature.</i>

330
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,369
<i>I'd have to disassemble
the sword to remove it,</i>

331
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,288
<i>so it'll probably rot inside, though.</i>

332
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,455
<i>That's kinda unpleasant.</i>

333
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,332
<i>I suppose we can wait and see for a while.</i>

334
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,794
You're the one
who said monsters are dangerous.

335
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,839
It's not like I forgot about that.

336
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,841
But I thought I had neutralized it

337
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,844
and that I could use it to my advantage.

338
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,971
But it didn't pan out.

339
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,599
{\an8}I guess it's impossible to use a monster
while keeping it alive.

340
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,518
What does it taste like?

341
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,103
Wanna try?

342
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,230
Oh, yeah!

343
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,033
There are a lot of doors,
but only two of them lead outside.

344
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,868
No need to worry
about surprise attacks, then.

345
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,125
This house seems quite comfortable.

346
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,377
The fact it has seven toilets
raises questions, though.

347
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,379
All right. Let's get some sleep here.

348
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,839
Hurray!

349
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,091
It's been so long
since I last slept on a bed!

350
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,677
We'll still have to use
our sleeping bags as blankets, though.

351
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,479
Sorry for intruding on your home
without asking.

352
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,981
We'll leave as soon as we rest a little.

353
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,900
What's the matter?

354
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,526
I think she's a resident.

355
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,903
She says she'll let us stay.

356
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,404
I see.

357
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,572
That's great.

358
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,661
We're short on sleeping bags,
so we'll have to share on the way back.

359
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,373
We haven't slept in the same bed
since our school days!

360
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,041
I wonder if we'll both fit.

361
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,795
I've gotten much bigger since then.

362
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,256
You cheeky little!

363
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:03,095
To me, you'll always be my little girl!

364
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,184
I'm really glad I got to see you again.

365
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,770
Me, too.

366
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,442
I'll go say goodnight
to my brother before bed.

367
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,364
Laios.

368
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,700
Falin.

369
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,834
This scar...

370
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,003
You did something reckless, didn't you?

371
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:36,962
Why did you...

372
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,636
Just to be clear, you're the one
who did something reckless first.

373
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,805
So it's on you
that things turned out like this!

374
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,723
What?

375
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,350
{\an8}Don't ever do something like that again!

376
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,603
I can't even recall what I did.

377
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,778
I won't do it again.

378
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,992
Goodnight, Laios.

379
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,995
Goodnight, Falin.

380
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,950
